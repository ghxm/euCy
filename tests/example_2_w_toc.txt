Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (Reach), establishing a European Chemicals Agency and amending Directive 1999/45/EC and Regulation (EC) {on Persistent Organic Pollutants} {SEC(2003 1171} /* COM/2003/0644 final - COD 2003/0256 */




Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (Reach), establishing a European Chemicals Agency and amending Directive 1999/45/EC and Regulation (EC) {on Persistent Organic Pollutants} {SEC(2003 1171}

(presented by the Commission)


Proposal for a DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL amending Council Directive 67/548/EEC in order to adapt it to Regulation (EC) of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals

EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM

Background to the proposal

Reasons for and objectives of the proposal

In February 2001 the Commission issued a White Paper on a 'Strategy for a future Chemicals Policy' (ref.: COM(2001) 88 final) based on a review of the existing EU system for regulating the safe use of chemicals. The Commission concluded that reform of the current legislation was necessary in order to meet the following objectives:

- protection of human health and the environment,

- maintenance and enhancement of the competitiveness of the EU chemical industry,

- prevention of the fragmentation of the internal market,

- increased transparency,

- integration with international efforts,

- promotion of non-animal testing,

- conformity with EU international obligations under the WTO.

General background

There are a number of factors that place the chemicals industry at the heart of the Community's sustainable development strategy. It plays a very important economic role, supplying materials to manufacturing industry, as well as stimulating innovation and supplying products needed to sustain and improve the quality of life. The chemicals industry is also a major contributor to economic development and Europe's balance of payments surplus. Maintaining a competitive and innovative chemicals industry in Europe is therefore a major goal.

At the social level, improving the health and safety of workers and the general public is a key political objective of the Community chemicals policy. Maintaining high levels of employment is also a key objective.

In relation to the environment, the avoidance of chemical contamination of air, water, soil and buildings, as well as preventing damage to biodiversity are also major goals. Improved control of persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic substances is of particular importance in this respect.

The need to advance these objectives has been endorsed at the highest political levels. The European Council in Brussels on 20/21 March 2003, on the one hand, stressed that competitiveness "must once again be placed centre stage" and that increased business investment in research and development (R & D) and innovation must be promoted. On the other hand, the Council emphasised the need to curb environmental pressures and preserve natural resources within the framework of the comprehensive sustainable development strategy launched at Gothenburg and to promote sustainable development on a global scale, including a follow up to the goals agreed in Johannesburg in relation, inter alia, to sound management of chemicals.

Current chemicals legislation

The present system for general industrial chemicals distinguishes between "existing substances" i.e. all chemicals declared to be on the market in September 1981, and "new substances" i.e. those placed on the market since that date.

There are some 3 000 new substances. Directive 67/548 requires new substances to be tested and assessed for possible risks to human health and the environment before they are marketed in volumes starting at 10 kg. For higher volumes more in-depth testing, focusing on long-term and chronic effects, has to be provided.

In contrast, existing substances amount to more than 99% of the total volume of all substances on the market, and are not subject to the same testing requirements. The number of existing substances reported in 1981 was 100 106, the current number of existing substances marketed in volumes starting at 1 tonne is estimated at 30 000. Some 140 of these substances have been identified as priority substances and are subject to comprehensive risk assessment carried out by Member State authorities under Regulation 793/93.

There is a general lack of publicly available knowledge about the properties and uses of existing substances. The risk assessment process is slow and resource-intensive and does not allow the system to work efficiently and effectively. The allocation of responsibilities is inappropriate because the public authorities are responsible for the assessment instead of the enterprises that produce, import or use the substances. Furthermore, current legislation requires only the manufacturers and importers of substances to provide information, but does not impose similar obligations on downstream users (industrial users and formulators). Thus, information on uses of substances is difficult to obtain and information about the exposure arising from downstream uses is generally scarce. Decisions on further testing of substances can only be taken via a lengthy committee procedure and can only be requested from industry after authorities have proven that a substance may present a serious risk. Without test results, however, it is almost impossible to provide such proof. Final risk assessments have therefore only been completed for a small number of substances.

Under Directive 76/769/EEC, restricting the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations, the Commission has committed itself to carry out risk assessments and adequate analyses of the costs and the benefits prior to any proposal or adoption of a regulatory measure affecting the chemical industry. Indications of unacceptable risk (typically arising from notifications of restrictions at national level) are the subject of reports, which are peer-reviewed by the Scientific Committee on Toxicology, Ecotoxicology and Environment (Cstee) of the Commission.

Current liability regimes are insufficient to remedy the problems identified in the Commission's review. Liability is usually based on the principle that those who cause damage should pay compensation for that damage. However, in order to be held liable, it is generally required that a causal connection be proven between the cause and the resulting damage. This is often virtually impossible for injured parties if cause and effect occur far apart in time and if adequate test data on the effects of substances are not available. Even if a causal connection can be established, compensation payments awarded by courts of EU Member States are generally not as high as, for example, in the US, and hence have a limited deterrent effect.

Coherence with other policies

Chemicals policy interfaces with a wide range of other policy sectors. In preparing its proposal, the Commission has been careful to avoid duplication of the provisions of other legislation, while not creating loopholes and ensuring that necessary information is made available to other sectors.

Results of public consultations and impact assessments

Public consultations

Following publication of the White Paper, there was a wide measure of consensus on the need for reform. Both the Council of Ministers and the Parliament clearly favoured development of more effective mechanisms and procedures which would place a greater onus on industry to make available information on the hazards, risks, and risk reduction measures for chemicals currently in use, and which would create greater confidence that dangerous substances were being used safely. Industry welcomed the new policy orientation towards enterprises themselves taking greater responsibility for the safety of their chemicals. At the same time they were concerned about the impact on competitiveness. Environmental non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and consumer organisations were strongly supportive of the need for change.

Internet consultation

In May 2003, the Commission decided to launch an Internet consultation to consider the workability of the draft legislation, including the technical requirements, without calling into question the scope and objectives of the system proposed. The consultation took place between 15 May and 10 July 2003. Respondents were able to submit their responses in several ways: through an online questionnaire, or via e-mail, fax and ordinary letter using a standardised template or free text. All responses were published on the Internet; names were withheld for respondents who wished to remain anonymous.

More than 6 000 distinct contributions were received. 42% of these were sent by industry - firms or associations. 142 NGOs, including trade unions, responded.

From the Member States, five governments (A, IRL, F, NL, UK) sent comments, as well as a number of public authorities (A, B, D, DK, FIN, GR, I, NL, S, UK). Public authorities from three Accession countries (LAT, LIT, PL) gave their input as well as authorities and governments from third countries (Australia, Canada, Chile, China, Israel, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Norway, Singapore, Switzerland, Thailand, USA). The international organisations Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) sent comments.

Approximately half of the contributions came from individuals. Many raised issues in relation to animal testing, others voiced fears of job losses or demanded increased protection of the environment and human health and better information for consumers. In addition, two petitions were submitted, supported by 34 000 individuals and organisations.

Main concerns and how they were addressed

Scope of the system: The inclusion of polymers and of substances in articles in the scheme was criticised by EU industry and foreign trade partners as excessive and difficult to implement. The requirement for all manufacturers, importers and downstream users to undertake chemical safety assessments was also criticised as going beyond the White Paper proposals.

- Polymers have been exempted from registration and evaluation, but may still be subject to authorisation and restriction. This may be amended by the Commission when sound scientific criteria have been developed for defining which polymers might be registered.

- Substances in articles have been addressed in a lighter way.

- The requirement to undertake chemical safety assessments has been considerably restricted.

Legal certainty: Industry feared that the duty of care would expose them to unlimited liability claims. They also raised concerns about the lack of an appeal mechanism in the Agency.

- Duty of care has been replaced by an explanation of the principles underpinning the Regulation.

- An appeal board has been included in the Agency.

Costs: Industry, some Member States and many foreign trade partners voiced concerns about excessive costs, in particular for low volume chemicals, downstream users and small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs).

- For downstream users, the requirement to undertake chemical safety assessments and produce chemical safety reports has been strictly limited.

- Registration obligations were simplified for 1-10 tonnes (no chemical safety reports need be submitted; testing requirements were reduced).

- Polymers (see above).

- Requirements for intermediates transported under strict control were reduced.

Bureaucracy/ Powers of the Agency: Many stakeholders criticised the fact that REACH was too bureaucratic and that the distribution of tasks (Member States and Agency) was too complex. They also expressed concerns that there would not be a harmonised approach to decision-making.

- Streamlined registration: the Agency will be solely responsible.

- Evaluation: the Agency will have a greater responsibility for the smooth running of the system and monitoring decision-making. The procedures have been restructured and made clearer.

- The system of chemical safety reports has been better co-ordinated with the already existing system of safety data sheets.

- The Agency now has boosted powers with regard to decisions on data sharing, research and development (R&D) exemptions and confidentiality.

Confidentiality and right to information about chemicals: Industry, in particular downstream users, has voiced concerns that they may be forced to disclose business secrets. NGOs have argued for a high level of transparency with regards to chemical composition of articles.

- Stricter protection of confidential business information: some types of information will always be treated as confidential, such as exact tonnage, customers' names etc. It will also be possible for companies to claim confidentiality if specific reasons are given and approved.

- All information that is non-confidential will be available on request (EC Regulation on public access), some items are published and freely available.

Substitution: NGOs, some branches of industry and some Member States have urged that there should be stronger provisions for substitution.

- There will be a clearer reference to substitution in the recitals and in the provisions on authorisation; companies will be encouraged to present substitution plans that will influence the authorisation decision.

Animal testing: Limiting animal testing has been one of the guiding principles in the drafting of the proposal. The Scientific Committee on Toxicology, Ecotoxicology and the Environment (CSTEE) voiced concerns that the animal tests envisaged would not yield sufficient information to avoid risks and stated that more tests would be necessary.

- Due to strong public pressure to limit animal testing, the number of tests has not been increased.

- To further reduce the need for animal testing without jeopardising human health and the environment, the use of qualitative or quantitative structure-activity relationship models, (Q)SARs, is encouraged; the text also clarifies that data sharing will be obligatory.

Impact assessments

Specific studies, notably in relation to the likely impact of the system proposed, were also initiated. The outcome of these are taken into account in preparing the impact assessment. As the proposal evolves, its impact will be monitored and followed up. Stakeholders will be involved in this exercise.

As regards the administrative aspects, the White Paper indicated that the administration of the new system would require the creation of a "central entity" which would have a key role in the management of Reach. The appropriate format of the "entity" was then considered to be the European Chemicals Bureau (ECB), part of the Joint Research Centre at Ispra, which would need to be enlarged to take on the extra tasks. Subsequent enquiry has raised serious doubts as to whether an enlarged ECB would be the most effective structure to meet the much increased demands of the new system. The Commission therefore undertook a feasibility study. Having carefully examined all elements, the Commission concluded that the establishment of a separate Agency is essential for the effective implementation of the proposed Reach system. Accordingly, the proposals provide for a new Agency. The interests of efficiency, continuity and optimum use of available expertise would point to Ispra as the most appropriate site for the Agency.

Collection and use of expertise

Following the publication of the White Paper, the Commission consulted widely with experts. This was done in the course of conferences, stakeholder working groups and in bilateral contacts between the services and stakeholders. The eight technical working groups convened by the Commission in 2001-2002 are of particular note in this regard. The consultation of relevant experts then continued throughout the drafting process.

Legal elements of the proposal

Legal basis

Article 95 of the EC Treaty is the appropriate legal basis because of the need to ensure a level playing field for all economic actors in the internal market while at the same time ensuring a high level of protection of health and the environment.

The choice of this legal basis ensures that the requirements for substances are harmonised and that substances complying with those requirements benefit from free movement throughout the internal market. This rewards the efforts which will be required from economic actors to maintain the level of protection required by this Regulation. Moreover, as substances, whether on their own or in preparations or articles are goods circulating within the internal market, it is important that they can do so under harmonised requirements.

Moreover, Article 95 paragraph 3 requires a high level of protection to be sought for proposals concerning health, safety, environmental and consumer protection. The Reach Regulation falls within this remit; hence the use of this legal basis does not compromise the level of protection.

Principles of subsidiarity and proportionality

Subsidiarity

In considering the issue of subsidiarity in the sense of Article 5 of the EC Treaty, it should be taken into account that the present legislation on chemicals already provides for an extensive control over the classification, labelling, marketing and use of substances and preparations. The new Regulation will to a large degree replace several existing pieces of legislation and will extend it to areas that have hitherto not been adequately dealt with. The subsidiarity issue therefore only arises with regard to this extension.

As chemicals are being traded across borders and as many of them can lead to cross-border contamination, Member States cannot by themselves achieve the objectives of the proposal sufficiently. Community wide legislation is therefore appropriate. In this context, it should be recalled that the opinions of both the Council and the European Parliament call for a strong system of EU legislation in order to achieve a high level of protection of health and the environment while at the same time ensuring a level playing field for all economic actors in the Internal Market.

Proportionality

An important feature of the new legislation in terms of proportionality (Article 1, paragraph 3 of the proposal) is the fact that the responsibility for the safe management of the risks of chemical substances will be placed on industry. This will permit industry to apply risk reduction measures from an early point in the life-cycle of the substance concerned and thereby to avoid negative impacts on downstream users and customers. It will also permit Member State competent authorities to direct their resources towards evaluating the quality of the information submitted by industry rather than doing risk assessments themselves.

While the new legislation is designed to cover all those chemical substances that can lead to a certain exposure of citizens or the environment, great care has been taken to ensure that the new legislation does not overreach in terms of scope, costs and administrative burden. This is why the new legislation provides for a tiered approach for certain classes of chemical substances. This is in particular the case with regard to low tonnage substances or special uses (e.g. for research and development).

At the same time this tiered approach leads to a somewhat lighter regime in terms of cost and administrative burden from which SMEs will be able to benefit, without diminishing the protection of health and the environment.

Choice of legal instrument

The use of a Regulation (that replaces some 40 existing Directives) is justified, as it will lead to the direct application of such legislation throughout the Community. In the area of technical legislation, this is a widely used technique that has already met with the support of Member States in other areas of Community competence [1]. It is all the more justified in the perspective of an enlarged Community that will soon comprise 25 Member States and will certainly benefit from homogenous and directly applicable rules throughout its territory.

[1] See the recent Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 on Food Law, as well as the Commission's recent proposals for Regulations on Fertilisers (COM(2001) 508), Detergents (COM(2002) 485) and Drug Precursors (COM(2002) 494).

Introduction to the proposal

This proposal establishes the Reach system and creates a European Chemicals Agency. In a nutshell, Reach consists of the following elements:

- Registration requires industry to obtain relevant information on their substances and to use that data to manage them safely.

- Evaluation provides confidence that industry is meeting its obligations and prevents unnecessary testing.

- Risks associated with uses of substances with properties of very high concern will be reviewed and, if they are adequately controlled, or if the socio-economic benefits outweigh the risks and there are no suitable alternative substitute substances or technologies, then the uses will be granted an Authorisation.

- The Restrictions procedure provides a safety net to manage risks that have not been adequately addressed by another part of the Reach system.

The Agency will manage the technical, scientific and administrative aspects of the Reach system at Community level, aiming to ensure that the Reach system functions well and has credibility with all stakeholders.

1. Reasons and Objectives

1.1. General Issues: Subject matter, scope and definitions

This sets out the scope of the Reach system and defines the terms used throughout the Regulation, and explains the principles on which the Regulation is based.

1.2. Registration

There is a general obligation to register substances manufactured or imported in quantities starting at 1 tonne. Failure to register means that the substance cannot be manufactured or imported.

The registration provisions oblige manufacturers and importers of substances to obtain, where necessary by performing new tests, knowledge on the substances they manufacture or import and to use this knowledge to ensure responsible and well informed management of the risks which the substances may present.

Manufacturers and importers shall address the risks of any use identified to them by their downstream users. A downstream user has the right not to identify a use, in which case he would have responsibility for performing a chemical safety assessment. Conversely, the manufacturer is not obliged to supply a substance for a use that he feels he cannot support. For purposes of enforcement as well as for reasons of transparency, the registration information is to be submitted to the authorities.

The Regulation exempts certain substances that are adequately regulated under other legislation or that generally present such low risks as not to require registration.

Registration requires submission of a technical dossier containing information on the substance and information on risk management measures, as well as - starting at 10 tonnes -the chemical safety report that documents the choice of these measures. The information requirement is modulated by tonnage, since this gives an indication of the potential for exposure. There are provisions on generation of information, which aim to ensure that it is of acceptable quality. To reduce costs for industry and authorities, it provides for joint submission of data.

For the registration of substances in articles, a special regime applies: in the interests of proportionality and, on the one hand, bearing in mind the millions of articles placed on the market in the EU and, on the other hand, the potential some of them may have to cause harm to human health and the environment, certain substances incorporated into articles have to be registered. This is required when the substance in question has hazardous properties and is intended to be released from the article. For substances that are released incidentally to the use of the article, a simple notification is required, on the basis of which the Agency may request a registration. The volume thresholds are as for any substance manufactured in, or imported into, the EU and apply per article type.

These requirements for certain substances in articles are necessary because of their potential impact on human health and the environment. It should be noted that no declaration of contents in articles is required from importers. The provisions place the same duties on importers and EU manufacturers of articles.

The enforcement activities of the authorities in regard to these provisions is largely expected to focus on cases where there is evidence that a substance released from articles is causing adverse effects on human health or the environment. Guidance will be developed by the Agency to assist producers and importers of articles, and the competent authorities, in implementing these provisions.

Polymers are exempted from the requirement to register. The Commission may introduce certain polymers into the requirement to register following a report on the risks posed by polymers in comparison with other substances and the need, if any, of registering certain types of polymers, taking account of competitiveness and innovation on the one hand and the protection of health and the environment on the other. A limited form of registration is required for certain isolated intermediates. A distinction is made between those intermediates that do not leave the site on which they are used, and those that are transported between sites under controlled conditions. In the latter case, where more than 1 000 tonnes are transported, as the risk of exposure is potentially slightly higher, more information is required.

There are a number of common provisions for all registrations, including the procedure for the Agency to manage registrations. Given that tens of thousands of registrations are expected, a simple completeness check will be performed. If the registration is not rejected within a set deadline, then industry may begin or continue to manufacture or import the substance.

In order to facilitate the transition to the Reach system, provisions are contained that phase in the registration requirements for substances that are already on the Community market. Finally, notifications under Directive 67/548/EEC are considered to be registrations, since such notifications provide a comparable level of information.

1.3. Data sharing and avoidance of unnecessary animal testing

A number of rules regarding data sharing are set out in order to reduce testing on vertebrate animals and to reduce costs to industry. Relevant data are to be shared, in exchange for payment. For phase-in substances, a system is established to help registrants to find other registrants with whom they can share data. They are then required to share data.

1.4. Information in the supply chain

The information through the supply chain provisions ensure that all users of substances have the information they need to use them safely. This requires information to be passed both up and down the supply chain, and between all actors in that supply chain. The primary tool for information transfer is the safety data sheet, as set out in Annex Ia. The Reach regulation replaces the current Safety Data Sheets Directive (91/155/EEC).

1.5. Downstream Users

These provisions oblige downstream users to consider the safety of their uses of substances, based primarily on information from their supplier, and to take appropriate risk management measures. They also allow authorities to have an overview of the uses of a substance as it moves through the supply chain and so can, if necessary, request further information and take appropriate measures.

For an identified use, a downstream user may use the risk management measures prepared by the manufacturer or importer but he must satisfy himself that the relevant exposure scenarios are consistent with his use and that he has implemented all the relevant risk management measures. Guidelines will be developed to ensure that this process is manageable, in particular for small and medium enterprises.

If a downstream user is using a substance in a way not covered by a manufacturer's or importer's chemical safety assessment (including incorporating it into an article) or if he intends to use different risk management measures, then he must send a short report to the Agency. This enables authorities to monitor the unidentified uses and could lead them to evaluate substances having unintended uses giving rise to concern.

Downstream users are not required to submit chemical safety assessments to the authorities because the administrative burden on both industry and authorities would be disproportionate. Furthermore this would require an obligation on downstream users to resubmit all updated safety assessments.

1.6. Evaluation

There are two types of evaluation:

- dossier evaluation which is twofold again:

- one aim is to prevent unnecessary animal testing. Therefore the regulation requires authorities to examine proposals for testing in order to check the quality before a test is performed and to prevent the same animal test to be performed repeatedly;

- furthermore, the regulation gives authorities the task to check compliance of registration dossiers with the requirements of the registration title;

- substance evaluation: provides a mechanism for an authority to require industry to obtain and submit more information in case of suspicion of a risk to human health or the environment.

To promote a consistent approach, the Agency will develop guidance on prioritisation of substances for evaluation. Member States then prepare rolling plans of the substances that they wish to evaluate. There is a procedure for resolving disagreements over which Member State should evaluate any substance.

When a draft decision is prepared by a Member State competent authority requiring further information on a substance, it must be accepted by other Member State competent authorities through a written procedure. The Agency is given responsibility for assuring the consistency of such decisions at the draft stage and takes those decisions when agreement is reached between Member States.

Evaluation may lead authorities to the conclusion that action should be taken under the restrictions or authorisation procedures in Reach, or that information should be passed to other authorities responsible for relevant legislation. The common feature of these regulatory activities is that they rely on good data. The evaluation process will ensure that such data is provided and made available to the relevant bodies by the Agency.

1.7. Authorisation

An authorisation system for uses of substances and the placing on the market of substances for such uses is established for the substances of very high concern. The substances selected for the authorisation system have hazardous properties of such high concern that it is essential to regulate them through a mechanism that ensures that the risks related to their use are assessed, weighed and then decided upon by the Community prior to actual use. This is justified because the effects of CMRs category 1 and 2 on humans are generally so serious and cannot normally be reversed so that such effects have to be prevented rather than remedied, and because PBTs/vPvBs accumulate in living organisms, so that accumulation would already have taken place and could not be reversed if regulatory action were only taken a posteriori. The same applies to the other substances of equivalent concern that may be made subject to authorisation on a case-by-case basis.

In line with the general Reach approach, the requirements for the applicants under the authorisation approach are risk-based, as he has to demonstrate that the risks related to the use of the substance concerned are adequately controlled or that they are outweighed by socio-economic benefits.

Thus, the authorisation provisions ensure that risks from the use of substances with properties of very high concern are either adequately controlled or authorised on socio-economic grounds, taking account of available information on alternative substances or processes, in which case the authorisations will normally be time-limited. Substances of very high concern are defined as: substances that are category 1 and 2 carcinogens or mutagens; substances that are toxic to the reproductive system of category 1 and 2; substances that are persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic or very persistent and very bioaccumulative; and substances such as endocrine disrupters which are demonstrated to be of equivalent concern.

The authorisation provisions require those using or making available substances with properties of very high concern to apply for an authorisation of each use within deadlines set by the Commission. Deadlines shall be set for a number of substances at a time. These are normally those that are considered to pose the greatest current risk, in accordance with the criteria identified in the text. The intent is that those selected should be those with the 'Highest Expected Regulatory Outcome' (Heros).

The burden of proof is placed on the applicant to demonstrate that the risk from the use is adequately controlled or that the socio-economic benefits outweigh the risks. Downstream users may use a substance for an authorised use provided they obtain the substance from a company for whom an authorisation has been granted and that they keep within the conditions of that authorisation. Such downstream users shall have to inform the Agency of this fact. This is so that the authorities are fully aware of how and where substances of very high concern are being used.

1.8. Restrictions

The restrictions provisions enable risk reduction measures to be introduced across the Community where this is shown to be necessary. The restrictions provisions act as a safety net for the whole Reach system as well as for the Community legislation as a whole because any substance on its own, in a preparation or in an article may be subject to Community-wide restrictions if a risk needs to be addressed.

Proposals for restrictions may consist of conditions for the manufacture, use(s) and/or placing on the market of a substance or of the prohibition of these activities if necessary. They shall be prepared by Member States or the Commission in form of a structured Dossier. This Dossier is required to demonstrate that there is a risk to human health or the environment that needs to be addressed at Community level and to explore the options for managing that risk.

The restrictions provisions are the result of a balance of the need to ensure that action is taken where required as rapidly as possible, to provide a sound scientific basis for any restriction and to enable all interested parties to participate in the procedure.

Up to now, Directive 76/769/EEC as amended approximated the laws governing the restrictions in the Member States.. The current restrictions are now taken over in a recast version as a starting point for the new restrictions procedure.

1.9. European Chemicals Agency

These provisions create the European Chemicals Agency (Agency) to manage the technical, scientific and administrative aspects of the Reach system, and ensuring consistency of decision making, at Community level.

The Agency manages the registration process, plays a key role in ensuring consistency of evaluation, provides criteria to guide Member States' selection of substances for evaluation and takes decisions requiring further information on substances under evaluation. It also provides opinions and recommendations in the authorisation and restriction procedures and has duties with regard to confidentiality.

In its White Paper on the strategy for a future chemicals policy, the Commission proposed to create a central entity to administer the Reach system and provide scientific and technical support. It also proposed a feasibility study on this entity. This study considered two main options for the structure of the entity: an enlarged European Chemicals Bureau (ECB) within the Commission's Joint Research Centre and an independent central agency. The study concluded that an independent central agency offered a number of advantages over an enlarged ECB.

The first advantage of the Agency is that it can use income from fees to fund staff posts whereas an enlarged ECB could not. The ECB would have to receive the fees into a dedicated line in part B of the Community budget. The other advantages are set out in the White Paper on European Governance [2], which notes that regulatory agencies:

[2] COM(2001) 428 final, 25.7.2001.

- improve the way rules are applied and enforced across the Union. The work of the Committees, the Secretariat and the Forum will meet this goal,

- increase the visibility for the sector concerned. The existence of a separate, independent body provides a clear focus for discussions and so raises the profile of the sector,

- have an advantage in drawing on highly technical sectoral know-how. The Agency, in particular the Committees, the Secretariat and the Forum, provide a structure to use this know-how,

- offer cost savings to business. The Agency has a clearly defined role and so can focus on developing the most cost-effective methods and so limit the fees charged to industry,

- allow the Commission to focus on its core tasks. The task of the Agency is the technical implementation of Reach and this is not appropriate for a Commission service.

The main advantage of an enlarged ECB would be short-term continuity. However, this alone does not outweigh the advantages of an independent Agency which will operate in the long-term. Accordingly, the Agency option was chosen.

In designing the structure of the new Agency, the Commission considered the experience with existing agencies in other fields, in particular those in related fields. It also followed the principles set out in its recent Communication [3] on the operating framework for European Regulatory Agencies. The European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (Emea) provided the most useful model because it is the regulatory agency whose role is closest to that of the proposed chemicals Agency, in that it deals with a continuous stream of products requiring evaluation and that there are established Member States' competent authorities (CAs). The European Food Safety Authority (Efsa) model has provided some useful elements for this proposal but it differs from the proposed chemicals Agency in that a significant part of its role is to deal with specific problems as they arise and in an area where not all Member States have long-standing national authorities. A number of new elements have also been developed to address the specific nature of the chemicals sector.

[3] COM(2002) 718 final, 11.12.2002.

The Agency will be the public face of the new Reach system and will be a key player in ensuring that the system has credibility with all stakeholders and the public.

The Agency will comprise the following elements:

- a Management Board of 15 members,

- an Executive Director, reporting to the Management Board,

- a Committee on risk assessment, a Committee on socio-economic analysis and a Member State Committee. These Committees may be asked to provide opinions under the evaluation, authorisation and restriction procedures. Each Member State may nominate a member to each Committee,

- a Forum for exchange of information on enforcement activities. This Forum implements the White Paper proposal to create a network of enforcement authorities. The tasks of the Forum are essentially a continuation of those previously undertaken by an informal network of Member States authorities. Work in this area would benefit from operating in a more formal framework. Each Member State shall nominate a member to the Forum,

- a Secretariat that will provide technical, scientific and administrative support for the Committees. It will also undertake a number of tasks without reference to the Committees. Involving the Committees would overburden them and would provide no added value,

- a Board of Appeal that will consider any appeals against the decisions of the Agency.

Accession countries, on joining the European Union, will be represented on the Management Board, Committees and Forum on the same basis as existing Member States.

1.10. Classification and Labelling Inventory

The provisions for a classification and labelling inventory ensure that classifications (and consequent labelling) of all dangerous substances manufactured in, or imported into, the EU are available to all to ensure the smooth running of the Reach system. Industry will be required to include all its classifications on the inventory. Any divergences between classifications of the same substance should be removed over time either through co-operation between notifiers and registrants or by EU harmonisation. EU harmonised classifications will only be required for the following properties: Substances that are category 1, 2, and 3 carcinogens, mutagens or toxic to the reproductive system; or respiratory sensitisers.

1.11. Information

These provisions ensure non-confidential information on chemicals is available, for example to allow those exposed to chemicals to make decisions on the acceptability of the related risks. This is done in such a way that the interests of the public's 'right to know' is balanced with the need to keep certain information confidential.

1.12. Competent authorities

These provisions require that there are authorities in each of the Member States with the competence and resources necessary to fulfil the tasks allocated to them.

1.13. Enforcement

These provisions ensure that all Member States take a broadly common approach to enforcement of the Regulation.

1.14. Transitional and final provisions

These provisions ensure that the Regulation enters into force in a practical and effective way. The provisions ensure a smooth start-up as well as introducing the provisions of the Regulation in such a way that the current levels of protection are not reduced.

2. Content of the Regulation

2.1. General Issues

Article 1 - Subject matter

This sets out the purpose of this Regulation, namely to ensure the effective functioning of the common market for chemical substances, whilst ensuring that human health and the environment are not adversely affected by the manufacture or use of chemicals under reasonably foreseeable conditions. This Regulation is underpinned by the precautionary principle whose conditions of application are outlined in the Communication from the Commission on the precautionary principle (COM(2000) 1 final).

Article 2 - Scope

Radioactive substances are excluded from the scope because they are addressed by other legislation. Substances under customs supervision which are in temporary storage, in free zones or free warehouses with a view to re-exportation or in transit are not used within the meaning of Reach and so are also excluded. Non-isolated intermediates are not within the scope. Reach provides information on substances that will support the operation of worker protection and transport legislation, which operate unchanged.

Article 3 - Definitions

The essential terms in this Regulation are defined.

2.2. Registration of substances

Article 4 - Scope

This Article exempts substances in applications for which other legislation requires adequate information. Substances listed in Annex II are exempted as their properties and risks are considered to be adequately well known. This follows historical precedent in existing EU legislation. Most of the categories of substance in Annex III are exempted because their risks will be addressed through the assessment of other registered substances. Registered substances which have been exported from the Community and which are subsequently re-imported (e.g. in preparations) are exempted from registration provided that the re-importer possesses the information for the management of the risks as required by the Regulation. Finally, information is required for certain intermediates. This is addressed in Chapter 4.

Article 5 - General obligation to register substances on their own or in preparations

This Article lays down the basic obligation to submit a registration to the Agency as the central receiving authority in the Community. The obligation is imposed for manufacturers and importers established within the Community who manufacture or import a substance in quantities starting at 1 tonne per year. Below this quantity, there is no requirement to submit information, in view of the more limited potential for exposure and the workability of the system. Creating a manufacture-based system eliminates current problems with the re-import of notified substances and assists worker protection. Monomers have to be registered as any other substance, even if they are used as intermediates, and it is clarified that the lighter rules on intermediates do not apply to them. This is necessary because the polymers resulting from their use as intermediates are not subject to registration. Moreover, this article requires the registration of certain monomers and other substances, which are not yet registered and are present in proportions of more than 2% in polymers.

Article 6 - General obligation to register substances in articles

This Article places a duty on producers and importers of articles to register the substances incorporated in them if they meet the criteria for classification as dangerous, are intended to be released during normal and reasonably foreseeable conditions of use, and are present in the article type in quantities of 1 tonne or more per year. The registration requirements will follow those for the different thresholds as laid out in Article 9.

Manufacturers or importers shall also notify the Agency of certain specified information if substances contained in articles meet the criteria for classification as dangerous, are known to be released during normal and reasonably foreseeable conditions of use even though this is not an intended function of the article in quantities that may adversely affect human health or the environment, and are present in the article type in quantities of 1 tonne or more per year. The Agency shall be able to require the producers and importers concerned to register such notified substances.

To assist enforcement authorities, including customs authorities in the implementation of this Article and to promote consistency, express provision is made for further legislation to be developed.

Article 7 - Exemption from the general obligation to register for product and process orientated research and development (Ppord)

To promote innovation, substances used for product and process orientated research and development (Ppord) are exempted. This exemption shall be for up to 5 years and apply to the quantity of substance being used for Ppord and a limited number of listed customers. Certain information has to be provided to the Agency. The Agency shall be responsible for checking the information provided as well as imposing any relevant conditions. The exemption period may be extended by the Agency for up to a further 5 years upon application as long as this can be justified by the programme of research and development. In the case of development of medicinal products, extension is possible for up to 10 years. Competent Authorities in Member States in which the manufacture, import or Ppord takes place shall be provided with all information submitted in notifying a request for a Ppord exemption. The Agency shall take into account the views of the Competent Authorities concerned when making decisions on Ppord exemptions or extensions.

There is no need for a separate explicit exemption for scientific research and development below one tonne per year because production, import and use of substances, including for such purposes, up to a volume of one tonne per year is already outside the scope of the registration obligation.

Article 8 - Substances in plant protection and biocidal products

These substances are deemed registered only in as afar as they are used for biocides and plant protection products because the relevant legislation requires the submission of substantial information. Downstream users, who employ these substances as biocides or plant protection products are deemed to be making an identified use within the meaning of Reach. However, if a downstream user makes another, unidentified, use of such a substance, he shall report this use and can use the information supplied to him to prepare his chemical safety assessment.

Article 9 - Information to be submitted for general registration purposes

Information is required on the identity of the registrant, the identity of the substance, and its intrinsic properties. A chemical safety report (CSR), including details of risk management measures, is required for registrations of substances manufactured or imported in quantities starting at 10 tonnes per year by a manufacturer or importer.

Annexes IV to IX set out the requirements for generating information on the substance to be registered. Further details of these annexes are given below.

Article 10 - Joint submission of data by members of consortia

To reduce costs for industry and authorities, joint submission of data is encouraged. The reduced fee balances encouragement of joint submission with the need to ensure adequate income for the operation of the Agency.

Article 11 - Information to be submitted depending on tonnage

The information requirements are tiered, since the potential exposure increases with volume. The requirements of paragraph 2 ensure that information available to authorities is up to date and apply as soon as a higher tonnage threshold is crossed.

The information required at the different tonnages balances the costs of developing such information and the impact on industry with the benefits to human health and the environment likely to accrue from this information.

Article 133(3) provides that the information at the 1 to 10 tonne level will be reviewed as part of the first review of the operation of this Regulation, 6 years after the establishment of the Agency. As a result of the review the Commission may, through a Committee procedure, modify these information requirements. It is recognised that considerable work is currently under way to develop alternative approaches to identifying the information required for registrations. For example, in vitro methods and the use of (quantitative) structure activity relationships ((Q)SARs). The development of such approaches shall also be taken into account in any proposals to modify the information requirements for 1 to 10 tonne registrations.

Article 12 - General requirements for generation of information on intrinsic properties of substances

This Article lays down the basic rules for generating information, whether by testing, (Q)SARs or other means. The test methods set out in Annex X have been approved for use under current legislation and so are carried over to Reach. Other methods may be used if the registrant can justify their suitability. This is especially important in the case of data generated before the entry into force of the legislation, for example for existing substances or for substances that were already manufactured or marketed outside the Community. Any new testing is required to adhere to good laboratory practice to ensure the quality of the information and to the legislation on the protection of animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes.

The article also requires registrants wishing to refer to data already submitted to the Agency to demonstrate that they have the agreement of the owner of those data.

Article 13 - Chemical safety report and duty to apply and recommend risk reduction measures

The chemical safety report (CSR) details a chemical safety assessment (CSA). This is a risk assessment in which the registrant takes account of the risk management measures that he either implements himself for his own uses or proposes to downstream users for their uses. The uses addressed in the registrant's CSA are known as identified uses. This is not the classic model of risk assessment as understood by persons involved in chemicals' regulation today. The terms "chemical safety report" and "chemical safety assessment" are chosen to make this change clear.

In the interests of proportionality, CSRs are not required for registrations of substances manufactured or imported in quantities of less than 10 tonnes per year by a manufacturer or importer, on-site isolated intermediates, or transported isolated intermediates. Article 133(1) empowers the Commission to review the application of the requirement to substances in those quantities 12 years after the Regulation enters into force.

A registrant's CSA shall address all uses identified to the registrant by his downstream users, unless he chooses not to supply the substance for that use. This requirement ensures that those creating or importing substances cannot shift responsibility for assessing the safe management of a substance onto downstream users, who may be ill-equipped to deal with it. It also facilitates the work of authorities.

Certain uses do not need to be addressed in the CSA as they are adequately addressed by other EU legislation.

A CSA does not need to be conducted if the concentration of the substance in a preparation is below defined concentration limits because below these concentration limits the substance is considered not to pose a significant risk to human health and the environment. A CSA only needs to consider the steps of exposure assessment and risk characterisation if the substance meets the criteria for classification as dangerous or is assessed to be a PBT or vPvB. This is because it is only in these cases that there is a significant risk to human health or the environment.

Article 14 - Polymers

In view of the potentially large number of polymer registrations and given that most of them pose a limited risk because of their nature, polymers are exempted from registration for reasons of workability, and to focus resources on substances of more concern. However, the Commission is committed to considering how polymers should be addressed in Reach in the future. Before any proposal for introducing certain polymers into the requirement to register is made the Commission shall prepare a report looking at the risks of polymers in comparison with other substances and whether, considering the balance between protecting human health and the environment and ensuring competitiveness and innovation on the other, certain types of polymers should be registered.

Articles 15 and 16 - Registration of on site and transported isolated intermediates

For reasons of workability and to focus resources on substances of more concern, these articles introduce limited registration requirements for certain isolated intermediates. Non-isolated intermediates are excluded from Reach.

A distinction is made between isolated intermediates that remain on site, and those that are transported to other sites under controlled conditions. For the latter type of intermediate, where more than 1000 tonnes per manufacturer per year are transported, more data is required as the risk of exposure is potentially higher.

Article 17 - Joint submission of data by participants of consortia

See Article 10 for explanation.

Article 18 - Duties of the Agency

This Article defines the processing of registrations submitted and the role of the Agency at the registration stage of Reach. Registrations will be submitted and handled electronically in order to facilitate the management of many thousands of registrations. The Agency is the central receiving authority for all registrations. It assigns to each of them a registration number and date and will perform a completeness check which, again in view of the large number of registrations to be handled, is essentially an automated process. Having the Agency perform the completeness check ensures the necessary consistency of approach at the registration stage. The Agency shall let the registrant know if the registration is incomplete and, if so, the information needed and a deadline to complete the registration. The result of the completeness check will be referred to the Member State Competent Authority in which the manufacturer or importer is established. The Agency does not explicitly accept registrations because registration is not an approval system.

Article 19 - Manufacturing and import of substances

This Article prohibits the manufacture or import of substances that have not been registered in accordance with the registration provisions. It permits the manufacture or import of a substance 3 weeks after the registration date, unless the Agency indicates otherwise. If the Agency requests further information, manufacture or import of a substance is permitted 3 weeks after this further information is submitted unless the Agency indicates otherwise. The deadline is chosen to allow time for a completeness check. If a manufacturer or importer is acting as the lead in a consortium the other members of the consortium are not allowed to manufacture or import the substance until the deadlines have passed for the 'lead' registrant.

A longer deadline is not needed for this purpose as the completeness check is largely automated and would unnecessarily delay the manufacture or import of new substances.

Article 20 - Further duties of registrants

This Article places a duty on the registrant to inform the Agency of any changes in certain elements of his registration. It ensures that the authorities receive the latest information on safety of chemicals, while not requiring updates for minor changes. The obligation to report significant changes in manufactured or imported volumes provides essential information for the development of a chemicals indicator and keeps the information in the database up-to-date. Significant new knowledge of risks of the substance is such as would lead to changes in the chemical safety assessment.

Article 21 - Specific provisions for phase-in substances

This Article phases the vast majority of substances currently being manufactured or marketed into the registration system. The deadlines are chosen, bearing in mind the large number of phase-in substances, to ensure that the process is manageable for both industry and authorities. The registration process for phase-in substances starts with substances manufactured or imported in high volumes, given the high potential exposure, and substances with properties of very high concern.

Article 22 - Notified substances

Because the notification requirements under Directive 67/548/EEC are substantially similar to those for registration, this article provides that previously notified substances shall be deemed registered. Such registrations will have to be updated as for any other registration. It is intended that the Agency will assure the transfer of the notified data to its central database. If such substances subsequently exceed the next higher tonnage threshold of Article 9, then full information will be required as for any other substance, including information not yet submitted for the lower tonnage threshold.

2.3. Data sharing and avoidance of unnecessary testing

Article 23 - Objectives and general rules

This Article sets out the general principles for sharing data and ensuring that unnecessary animal testing is avoided. Paragraph 2 ensures that there are no concerns under Community competition rules. Paragraph 3 allows the Agency to make data that have been in the possession of the Agency for at least 10 years, freely available to others for the purposes of registration.

Article 24 - Duty to inquire prior to registration

This Article allows potential registrants of a substance that they have not manufactured or placed on the market at the moment that the Reach system enters into force to obtain data from previous registrants of that substance. Payment for data is required within ten years of the first registration that contains the relevant data, since this is the period when an innovative registrant has most to gain from marketing his substance.

Article 25 - Sharing of existing data involving tests on vertebrate animals between registrants

Registrants are encouraged to reach agreement on data sharing directly or via an arbitration board. However, given the importance of animal protection, the Agency is empowered to make the information available to the subsequent registrant if no deal has been reached. The subsequent registrant is expected to pay an equal share of the costs incurred. If necessary the first registrant can make a claim through the national courts for such an equal share of the costs they incurred in generating the information from the subsequent registrant.

Article 26 - Duty to pre-register for phase-in substances

Registrants wishing to use the phase-in provisions in the registration chapter are required to pre-register information on their substances so as to permit sharing of data that is already available. The provision enables manufacturers and importers of substances in quantities of less than 1 tonne to voluntarily contribute to the sharing of data.

Article 27 - Substance Information Exchange Fora

This Article creates a substance information exchange forum (Sief) composed of all those who have pre-registered the same substance and imposes duties on its participants in order to avoid duplicate animal testing.

Article 28 - Communication within the Sief prior to registration

This Article sets out the steps to be taken by participants of a Sief to fulfil their duties. Note that the provisions in paragraph 2 are presented only to clarify what actions other participants in the Sief may take if an owner of a study refuses to provide information. The owner of the study will be in breach of his obligations and will be subject to sanctions. If the owner of a study has already submitted his registration containing the study, the Agency will make it available to other participants of the Sief.

2.4. Information in the Supply Chain

Article 29 - Requirements for safety data sheets

This Article explains that the safety data sheet (SDS) is the instrument for conveying the relevant information from manufacturer, importer or downstream user down the supply chain. SDS are the best instrument to do this because they are now well known and understood by all actors in the supply chain and to require a new instrument would increase costs for little benefit to human health and the environment. The current duties and responsibilities for SDS remain and will be extended by the requirement to convey information from any relevant chemical safety assessment.

It is recognised that to prepare an SDS for a preparation containing many registered substances could be a complicated exercise. The option is therefore open for those preparing SDS for a preparation to carry out a CSA for the preparation as a whole and for the SDS to reflect this CSA rather than the individual CSAs for all registered components of the preparation.

The 16 headings required for SDS are consistent with those agreed in the Globally Harmonised System for the Classification and Labelling of Dangerous Chemicals (GHS). If a CSA was performed, the relevant exposure scenarios examined there provide useful and adequately structured information for others in the supply chain. It is therefore foreseen that they be placed in an annex to the SDS.

Article 30 - Duty to communicate information down the supply chain for substances and preparations for which a safety data sheet is not required

Downstream users and distributors need certain information on substances even if a SDS is not required so that they can take any necessary action. For example, requesting details of the registration of the substance, ensuring that their use complies with any authorisation or restriction. This information needs to be updated in a timely manner so that any appropriate action can be taken as a result.

Article 31 - Duty to communicate information on substances and preparations up the supply chain

This Article specifies the information that must be passed up the supply chain. Information is passed up the supply chain so that identified risk reduction measures can be refined if necessary. For example, this might be exposure information, additional information on the effects of a substance, or information on how the risk reduction measures work in practice.

The system set out in the Regulation will be at its most effective if information is supplied along the length of the supply chain and in both directions.

Article 32 - Access to the safety data sheet information for workers

The information in SDS and that communicated under Article 30 when an SDS is not required shall be made available to workers and their representatives. Making SDS available to workers and their representatives is consistent with the GHS.

Article 33 - Obligation to keep information

This requires all actors in the supply chain to keep all the information generated under the Regulation and make it available as requested. This information should be kept together so that authorities can have ready and immediate access to it so that any action to help protect human health and the environment can be taken quickly and to ensure that all relevant information is available when decisions are being taken under other parts of the system (e.g. evaluation, restrictions, authorisation).

2.5 Downstream Users

Article 34 - Downstream user chemical safety assessments and duty to apply and recommend risk reduction measures

The system for registration and in particular CSAs has been constructed in such a way that manufacturers and importers cannot pass down to downstream users responsibility for preparing CSAs if the downstream user does not wish them to do so. Downstream users are of course free to assist their suppliers in the preparation of a registration and this possibility is expressly laid down in the text. Moreover, if the downstream user wants the supplier's CSA to address their uses he should tell them in writing. This act makes the downstream user's use an identified use and must therefore be covered, as long as sufficient notice is given, in the manufacturer's or importer's CSA.

Downstream users must prepare chemical safety reports in accordance with Annex XI for uses outside the conditions described in an exposure scenario included in the SDS supplied to them. This provision enables downstream users to keep their use(s) confidential from their supplier if they should wish to do so. However, downstream users need not prepare a chemical safety report:

- if they take more thorough risk management measures than those recommended by their supplier, as in this case, there is no real added value to be gained from an obligation to prepare a chemical safety report, nor

- for non-hazardous substances, nor

- in cases where their supplier would not have had to prepare a chemical safety report.

Downstream users must apply the risk reduction measures identified in the SDS for identified uses and identified in their CSA for unidentified uses. Information on risk reduction measures identified in the SDS for identified uses or identified in the downstream user's CSA for unidentified uses must be passed on as relevant to their downstream users so that they, in turn, can apply the identified risk reduction measures or, if their use is not covered, conduct their own CSA.

Article 35 - Obligation for downstream users to report information

If his downstream use is outside the conditions described in the exposure scenario included in an SDS communicated to him, the downstream user must report the use to the Agency.

The scope of the report is limited so as to minimise the burden on industry and on authorities. It is sufficient, however, to allow authorities to decide whether to take further action under, for example, the evaluation or restrictions provisions or to take enforcement action. A report may, in some exceptional cases, contain proposals for testing. If such tests were drawn from Annexes VII or VIII the authorities would subject them to a dossier evaluation.

A downstream user may, through conducting a CSA or otherwise, conclude that the classification and labelling for a substance is different to that given to them by their supplier. This fact must be reported to the Agency.

A pre-defined format for reports is used to help downstream users to meet their obligations and to permit the Agency to handle efficiently the downstream user reports.

Updating of reports ensures that the Agency and hence Member States Competent Authorities are always aware of the latest relevant information on the use of a substance and so can, where necessary, take appropriate action.

Downstream users do not have to report if they are using a substance in quantities of less than 1 tonne.

Article 36 - Application of downstream user obligations

Downstream users will receive information on the safe use of their substances through safety data sheets provided by their suppliers. They should also already have performed a risk assessment for worker protection in accordance with Directive 98/24/EC. Nevertheless it is prudent to delay the application of the provisions of Article 35 to allow time for new safety information to flow down the supply chain and for downstream users to complete and update their risk or chemical safety assessments, if required. Application of the provisions of Article 36 is delayed until after a substance is registered, to avoid unnecessary reporting.

2.6. Evaluation of substances

Article 37 - Scope

Since polymers are exempted from registration, they are also exempted from evaluation. However, this exemption is also subject to the review foreseen in Article 133(3) and may be adapted accordingly.

Article 38 - Competent Authority

This Article sets out how the evaluating Member State competent authority is identified.

For dossier evaluations this shall be the competent authority of the Member State in which the manufacture takes place or the importer is established. This is because the dossiers are examined individually anyway and it avoids language and communication problems. In the case of consortia, the competent authority of the Member State in charge of the dossier of the 'leader' is the competent authority for evaluation.

For substance evaluations a different rule applies: Member States are required to establish evaluation rolling plans covering three years and listing the substances they intend to evaluate. This is to enable Member States to plan for and assign resources to substance evaluation. A specific allocation mechanism is foreseen for the event that more than one Member State plans to evaluate the same substance, to avoid duplication of work and encourage swift evaluation of the substance concerned. A factor taken into account when applying this mechanism is each Member State's proportion of the total Community gross domestic product.

Article 39 - Examination of testing proposals

This article requires the evaluating authority to perform a dossier evaluation of all proposals for testing to fulfil the information requirements in Annexes VII and VIII. These Annexes are chosen because they contain the tests that are the most expensive and require the greatest number of vertebrate animals to be used. It is therefore important for animal welfare reasons that the authorities are convinced that such testing is appropriate. Furthermore experience with present legislation has shown there is rarely any disagreement between industry and authorities over whether to perform the animal tests now contained in Annex V and VI.

Downstream users may make proposals for testing if their use is not an identified use and not therefore covered by the information in the safety data sheet.

If the authority agrees with a proposal, it drafts a decision requiring the test to be carried out and setting a deadline. This is so that the obligations on the registrant are clear and other authorities will know when the data will be available.

Article 40 - Compliance check of registrations

A competent authority may check that any registration it is responsible for is in compliance with the Registration requirements. If not, the competent authority may prepare a draft decision requiring the registrant to supply the missing information. Information is missing when no data was submitted or when the data submitted was insufficient.

Article 41 - Check of information submitted and follow-up to dossier evaluation

Once any additional information required under Articles 39 and 40 has been submitted the competent authority shall examine the registration and additional information and draft a further decision if yet further information is required.

Once a dossier has been evaluated the competent authority may decide that further action should be taken to manage the substance in question. This may mean proposing action under Authorisation or Restrictions or by referring relevant information to the authorities responsible for other legislation.

Article 42 - Procedure and time periods for examination of testing proposals

This Article sets a deadline of 120 days for completing dossier evaluations of testing proposals for non phase-in substances. This is to ensure that industry receives permission to perform any testing and so can collect all relevant information within the deadlines foreseen. It also sets deadlines for performing dossier evaluations of testing proposals for phase-in substances in order to make the operation of the system more predictable and transparent for all stakeholders.

It gives precedence to evaluations of testing proposals in view of the need to meet the deadlines set and reflecting the importance of animal protection.

Article 43 - Procedure and time periods for compliance check

A competent authority shall have a maximum of 12 months to complete a compliance check once started, including preparing a draft decision.

Article 44 - Request for further information

This Article enables the responsible competent authority to draft a decision requiring further information to clarify whether a substance presents a particular risk to human health or the environment. For example, the substance may appear to be similar to another that has particular properties that have not been identified yet for the substance in question.

A competent authority shall have a maximum of 12 months to complete a substance evaluation, including preparing a draft decision.

Article 45 - Coherence with other activities

To ensure consistency of decision-making, an evaluation must take account any previous evaluation of the substance. Any decisions under evaluation requiring further information on a substance previously evaluated can only be justified if further information has become available or circumstances have changed.

Article 46 - Check of information submitted and follow-up to substance evaluation

Once any additional information required under Article 44 has been submitted the competent authority shall examine the registration(s) and additional information and draft a further decision if yet further information is required.

Once a dossier has been evaluated the competent authority may decide that further action should be taken to manage the substance in question. This may mean taking action under Authorisation or Restrictions or by referring relevant information to the authorities responsible for other legislation.

Article 47 - Further information on on site isolated intermediates

For reasons of workability, this article excludes isolated intermediates on site from dossier and substance evaluation. However, Member States may ask for additional information and take necessary action on such a substance if they can demonstrate that its use gives rise to a risk equivalent to the level of concern arising from the use of substances subject to authorisation.

Article 48 - Registrants' rights

Registrants or downstream users potentially affected by an evaluation decision shall have the right to comment on the draft decisions being prepared by a competent authority and to have those comments taken into account.

In normal circumstances a registrant shall not be responsible for producing the additional information required by evaluation if they have either stopped the manufacture or import of the substance, and informed the Agency that this is the case, or if they decide to stop manufacturing or importing the substance in light of the additional information requirements as a result of evaluation, and again have informed the Agency that this is the case. Only if there is a potential long-term risk to man or the environment and the registrant in question is responsible for contributing significantly to the exposure to that substance shall the registrant be responsible for providing the additional information. This is to avoid, in all but the most extreme cases, registrants being retrospectively liable.

Article 49 - Adoption of decisions under evaluation

This Article creates a procedure for securing agreement on evaluation decisions among Member State competent authorities before such decisions are taken by the Agency, without the necessity for a time consuming and resource intensive comitology procedure in every case. In case of disagreement, the Agency's Member State Committee provides a technical forum to resolve differences, again without the need for comitology. The Executive Director of the Agency is given the right to initiate this procedure in order to ensure consistent decision-making. Any Member State can require that a decision be taken by comitology.

Article 50 - Cost sharing in case of performance of tests involving vertebrate animals without an agreement reached between registrants

In the interests of animal welfare it is essential to ensure that information is shared. The quid pro quo is that costs are also shared. This article ensures the sharing of costs and information when additional information is required under evaluation. An arbitration board may be used to decide on claims for remuneration. If agreement cannot be reached on cost sharing then national courts shall make a decision.

Article 51 - Obligations for Member States to report to the Agency

In the interests of ensuring that the burden is fairly shared, every Member State shall prepare a report annually on the evaluations of testing proposals conducted over the previous year.

2.7. Authorisation

Article 52 - Aim of authorisation

The aim of the authorisation system is to ensure the good functioning of the internal market and that the substances of very high concern are used either in a way where the risks are adequately controlled or are replaced by suitable alternative substances or technologies. The reasoning behind this aim is explained above, under section 1.7.

Article 53 - General provisions

This Article specifies that substances included in Annex XIII can only be used and placed on the market by those companies who have been granted an authorisation and their customers, for the particular uses authorised, and in accordance with any conditions set in that authorisation, unless a specific use of that substance has been exempt from the authorisation requirement.

Substances of very high concern subject to authorisation but which are yet not on Annex XIII may continue to be used as long as they fulfil the other requirements placed on them under the Regulation and other applicable legislation.

The authorisation process shall not apply to the use of substances in preparations where the substance is not present in sufficient concentration for the preparation itself to be classified as having one of the properties that make substances on their own subject to authorisation. It shall also not apply to PBT or vPvB substances present in concentrations below 0.1%, this limit being the same as for CMR substances.

To help encourage innovation, the authorisation process shall not apply to substances being used solely for scientific research and development purposes or for product and process-orientated research and development purposes in quantities under 1 tonne.

Certain uses of substances are not subject to authorisation because their human health and environmental effects are considered to be addressed by equivalent Community legislation. It would be unreasonable to subject such uses to two systems with the cost and resources this would imply. The Commission will propose a modification of the legislation on medicinal products for human use and veterinary use respectively to address risks related to the environment. This will be part of the benefit/risk assessment which has to be positive as a prerequisite for approval of the medicinal product.

However uses in cosmetic products and in food contact materials addressed by Community legislation only consider human health impacts. Whilst these impacts do not need to be considered again, if a substance for these uses is identified as a PBT, vPvB or of equivalent concern to the environment it shall be subject to authorisation for those effects because the environmental impact has not been considered previously.

Article 54 - Substances to be included in Annex XIII

This specifies the properties of substances that make them subject to the authorisation process. Clear and objective criteria are available for the identification of substances that are category 1 and 2 carcinogens, mutagens, toxic to the reproductive system, and for some PBTs and vPvBs. However, some PBTs, vPvBs are not possible to identify through the application of the numeric criteria in the Regulation. Some substances of equivalent concern are also not possible to identify through objective criteria, although some endocrine disrupters will have already been identified through the CMR criteria. If these can be identified through other scientific or technical evidence on a case-by-case basis and are considered to be of an equivalent level of concern as regards their effects on human health or the environment to those identified through application of the objective criteria, they shall also be subject to the authorisation process. PBTs, vPvBs, and other substances considered to be of equivalent concern (e.g. some endocrine disrupters), shall be identified on a case-by-case basis following the process described in Article 56.

Persistent organic pollutants (POPs), as a sub-set of vPvBs, are subject to authorisation. However, the Stockholm Convention requires prescribed restrictions to be put in place for particular POPs. The application of prescribed restrictions for particular POPs is incompatible with the authorisation process; a company would not apply for authorisation for a use they know will not be granted. These POPs will therefore be subject to restrictions under the restrictions process to ensure that the Community meets its obligations under the Stockholm Convention and the United Nations Economic Committee for Europe (Unece).

Article 55 - Inclusion of substances into Annex XIII

This Article specifies what information has to be included in Annex XIII when a substance is included: first of all the identity of the substance as well as its properties that make it subject to the system. As it could be expected that very few, if any, new substances having these properties would be placed on the market, most of the substances with these properties of very high concern have already been used. Therefore, transitional arrangements are necessary for those substances that are already on the market at the moment when a substance is included in the Annex, in order not to force companies to interrupt their business until an authorisation can be granted to them. The Annex therefore specifies a 'sunset date' and a deadline. The 'sunset date' is the date by which unauthorised uses shall be prohibited. This is required so that authorities and applicants can plan, knowing when a decision should be reached. The deadline is the date by which applications for continued use of the substance must be received. Again this gives certainty to applicants in planning the preparation of their application and to authorities in planning the work necessary to process an application. If applications for authorisation are received by the deadline given, the uses concerned may be continued until a decision is taken even if this is after the 'sunset date'. This is to ensure that concerns do not have uses prohibited by default if the authorities have not taken a decision.

Certain uses may be exempted from the requirement to be authorised. Such a decision needs for example to take account of the application of other EU legislation to the use in question and whether the use is sufficiently controlled so ensuring that the risks to human health and the environment are adequately controlled. This would allow the authorisation process to concentrate on the uses of substances that are likely to pose the greatest risk rather than devoting resources to considering uses that are known to be adequately controlled and corresponds to the principle of proportionality. If as a result of the Reach system or of developing Community legislation, further uses are justified to be exempt from the authorisation requirement, such exempted uses can be added to the Annexes at a later stage in accordance with Article 130.

Whilst the authorisation process is designed to address substances of very high concern some will still be of higher concern than others. This shall address primarily substances with the 'highest expected regulatory outcome' (Hero), i.e. the control will have a greater impact on the protection of human health and the environment. The Agency shall prepare a draft list of priority substances for inclusion on Annex XIII so that there is a technical basis for a political decision taken by the Member States. Priority shall be given to substances with PBT or vPvB properties, wide dispersive use or high volumes. Third parties are given the opportunity to comment on the draft list. This list and the final list agreed through the regulatory procedure shall take account of the resources available for considering applications for authorisation. If the list includes too many substances and/or the deadlines are too short the system will not be able to cope. There is therefore no benefit in placing more substances on Annex XIII than can reasonably be dealt with.

Prior to being placed on Annex XIII any substance subject to authorisation may be subject to the restrictions process as there may be risks that need to be addressed at Community level in advance of any authorisation decision. However once substances are placed on Annex XIII they may not be subject to the restrictions process, addressing the risks to human health and the environment from the intrinsic properties set out in Article 54. If certain uses of these substances need not be authorised, conditions for such uses shall be added in Annex XIII when these uses are exempt from the authorisation requirement. However, substances for which all uses are prohibited, shall be banned under the general restrictions in Title VIII. An example for this are POPs. These may have been subject to authorisation but under the terms of the Stockholm Convention these may, once added to the list of POPs, need mostly be banned or otherwise restricted. This shall be carried out through the restrictions process.

Article 56 - Identification of substances referred to in Article 54 (d), (e) and (f)

This sets out the process by which PBTs, vPvBs and other substances which are considered on a case by case basis to have equivalent levels of concern as regards their effects on human health or the environment (e.g. some endocrine disrupters) shall be identified and agreed at Community level before they can be included in Annex XIII. The proposal shall be presented by a Member State in the form of a Dossier (see Annex XIV).

Article 57 - The granting of authorisations

The Commission shall be responsible for the granting or refusing of authorisations. The authorisation application and decision shall not address risks to human health and/or the environment of emissions of the substance from an installation for which a permit was granted in accordance with the IPPC Directive (Directive 96/61/EC) or from a point source governed by requirement for prior regulation under the Water Framework Directive (Directive 2000/60/EC) or arising from the use in a medical device as these emissions are adequately controlled under other Community instruments which are applied by the Member States. Therefore, this is necessary not to interfere with such other competences and to avoid differences between the decisions taken under different regulatory regimes as well as the resources in examining an impact twice.

Authorisations shall be granted if the risk to human health and the environment posed by a use is adequately controlled. A description of the notion of adequate control is given in section 6 of Annex I. If the risk is not considered to be adequately controlled, an authorisation may be granted if socio-economic benefits outweigh the risk to human health and the environment and if there are no suitable alternative substances or technologies. In this case alternatives will be carefully analysed. If the use posed a high risk and a reasonable alternative (taking into account cost, availability, and efficacy) were available this will be a key consideration in making an authorisation decision.

Authorisations granted have to specify whom the authorisation is given to, the substance and use authorised as well as any conditions that apply. This is important for the holder of the authorisation and also for their downstream users who would have to abide by the conditions of the authorisation. Authorisations may be subject to a review period and/or monitoring requirements. Review periods for authorisations may be established, for example, because of the use, the potential availability of an economic substitute, or the type of substance may make it inappropriate to grant an indefinite authorisation. Authorisations granted for socio-economic reasons shall normally be time-limited. Therefore, if such an authorisation is applied for an unlimited time, this has to be justified.

Authorisation decisions are taken after consideration of the effects on human health and the environment of the effects that required the substance to be authorised in the first place (specified in Annex XIII). They shall not consider other effects, for example, flammability. If a substance needs to be restricted because of effects not leading to authorisation they may be addressed through the restrictions process. The authorisation process concentrates on this limited number of effects because it will focus resources on the effects of highest concern thus enabling the system to efficiently process the highest number of substances and uses.

Article 58 - Review of authorisations

Authorisation decisions may need to be amended or withdrawn as a result of a review which can be done at any time when there is a change of circumstances. Such a change of circumstances can for example be changes in the scientific basis for an authorisation decision or that environmental quality objectives as defined under the IPPC Directive or Water Framework Directive are not met because of diffuse emissions to water or the air. Emissions from point sources however are dealt with under those Directives.

Authorisations may therefore be amended or even withdrawn if necessary, subject to the setting of deadlines for the original applicant to update their case, if further information comes to light that places doubt on the appropriateness of the original authorisation. While a review is ongoing, the Commission is empowered to suspend the authorisation in cases of serious and immediate risk, provided proportionality is taken into account.

A streamlined procedure is provided for renewal of time-limited authorisations.

Article 59 - Applications for authorisations

Any grouping of substances, uses and/or applicants will need to be justified in the application. The uses applied for can be for the applicant's own uses or for uses by their downstream users. The possibility of grouping is to enable the authorisation process to be as efficient as possible with no reduction in protection as well as allowing the possibility for sharing the burden of application between a number of applicants.

The information accompanying an application includes a chemical safety report detailing their chemical safety assessment. The assessment only needs to address the properties that led to an authorisation being required (specified in Annex XIII: CMR, PBT, vPvB etc). If the applicant has already submitted a registration for the substance they do not have to resubmit the chemical safety report as this will already have addressed the risk management measures required for the substance and use in question.

Bearing in mind the conditions for granting an authorisation, an applicant may submit a socio-economic analysis (SEA) of the impact of a granted or refused authorisation, in accordance with Annex XV, as well as an analysis of alternatives and a substitution plan, if this is considered to be appropriate. An authorisation decision shall be based on the information made available to the authorities. If an application for authorisation is turned down on the basis that the risks to human health and the environment are not adequately controlled, and no SEA has been submitted, the 'sunset date' will still apply. The applicant would therefore need to make a new application for authorisation for the use including a SEA. The implications of this are that the use in question would be prohibited until the authorisation were granted.

Article 60 - Subsequent applications for authorisation

This allows a subsequent applicant for authorisation to make use of the chemical safety report and, if applicable, a socio-economic analysis and available information on alternative substances or preparations, submitted previously if permission is given by the previous applicant. This is to save applicant and authority resources by avoiding repeat work for no benefit.

Article 61- Procedure for authorisation decisions

This sets out the process that will be followed. Applications for authorisations must be made to the Agency. Once received, the Agency has 10 months in order to prepare an opinion. If the applicant has been given permission to refer to a previous authorisation application this shall be reduced to 5 months. The opinion shall take account of the information made available to it by the applicant as well as any other information available. The setting of deadlines gives industry certainty on which to base commercial decisions and also encourages the authorities to come to decisions as rapidly as is reasonably possible.

When an application is received, non-confidential information on the identity of the substance and use(s) applied for will be put on the Agency's website. This is so that other interested parties can make the Agency aware of alternative substances or processes that may be less harmful to human health and the environment. The information posted on the website must however not be so detailed as to allow others access to commercially important and sensitive information.

The Agency shall prepare two opinions. One shall address the risk posed to human health and the environment and the second socio-economic factors. In the interests of fairness and openness the applicant will be given 2 months to comment on the opinions if they wish to do so, with the Agency given up to a further two months to amend its draft opinion if it sees fit. Once the opinion has been finalised, to aid transparency, it shall be made available to the Commission, Member States and the applicant and its non-confidential parts shall be published on the Agency website. The Commission shall then adopt its decision on the application under the advisory committee procedure.

Article 62 - Obligation of holders of authorisations

In order for customers to know if a substance has been subject to and granted an authorisation, any label for a substance on the market for an authorised use (this could include its use in a preparation or in an article) shall include its authorisation number. The downstream user will then be able to check easily on the Agency website whether they are using the substance within the conditions of its authorisation.

Article 63 - Downstream users

A downstream user may, according to Article 54, paragraph 2, use a substance within the conditions of an authorisation given to an actor further up the supply chain. In this case he shall notify the Agency if he is using a substance for such an authorised use. This is to enable the Member State authorities to check that the risks posed by substances of very high concern are being adequately controlled and/or within the conditions of an authorisation.

2.8. Restrictions on the manufacturing, marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations

Article 64 - General Provisions

This Article sets out in general terms that all restrictions for substances set out in Annexes XVI and XVII have to be followed by all who manufacture, use or place those substances on the market. The division into two paragraphs results from the different background of the restrictions: paragraph 2 and Annex XVII deal with restrictions that have their origin in the Stockholm Convention or the Unece Protocol on Persistent Organic Substances, i.e. in a broad international agreement, paragraph 1 and Annex XVI deal with all other restrictions.

As a starting point, the restrictions included in Directive 76/769/EEC as amended are taken over in Annex XVI in a recast version.

The restrictions in Annex XVI do not apply to substances being used for scientific research and development purposes and for product and process orientated research and development, if these substances are used in amounts of less than 1 tonne. The restrictions in Annex XVII do not apply to substances being used for laboratory scale research or as a reference standard. Thereby the exemption is tighter than the one applying to substances included in Annex XVI.

The Restrictions in Annex XVI or XVII do not apply to substances that are waste and where authorities have given permission for it to be treated in a waste treatment installation (e.g. being destroyed or recycled). The requirements on waste in the Community's earlier implementation of the Stockholm Convention and the Unece protocol will also apply as they may be more restrictive.

Article 65 - Introducing new and amending current restrictions

This Article specifies the conditions that have to be fulfilled in order to include a substance in Annex XVI and XVII as well as the procedure that has to be followed: the regulatory committee decides directly on restrictions for substances which meet the criteria as carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic, categories 1 and 2, and for which the Commission proposes restrictions for consumer use as well as for substances for which restrictions are included in the Stockholm Convention or the Unece protocol. For all other restrictions however the process in Articles 66 to 70 has to be followed. For the first two categories of substances, a sound scientific basis has already been provided either within the classification procedure or during the international agreement procedure whereas Articles 66 to 70 ensure that such a scientific basis is prepared for the other restrictions as well. Provision is also made to ensure an appropriate interface with the Directive on cosmetic products, as Reach should not be used as the tool to address issues which are only relevant to cosmetic products.

Article 66 - Preparation of a Proposal

This article details that either Member States or the Commission - via the Agency - may prepare a proposal for restrictions and what has to be done for proposed restrictions to be considered.

Proposals for restrictions shall be based on a risk assessment that identifies why Community-wide action is required. To help ensure that the process for restrictions can work quickly - the previous system for introducing restrictions was criticised as being too slow - risk assessments must adhere to certain requirements that are set out in Annex XIV. If Member State risk assessments do not in the opinion of the Agency meet those requirements, the proposal for restrictions shall not be considered further until these shortcomings are addressed.

In the interests of consistency across EU legislation, both Member States and the Agency shall take into account any risk assessment on the substance under any EU legislation.

To help ensure transparency in the process and that all those with an interest in a proposed restriction have the opportunity to provide relevant information to help in the decision making process, all risk assessments satisfying the requirements set out in Annex XVI are published on the Agency web-site. All interested parties are invited to both comment on the risk assessment and to provide information on the socio-economic impact of the restrictions proposed.

Article 67 - Agency opinion: Committee for risk assessment

This Article details the process that shall be followed within the Agency for the preparation of an opinion on the risk assessment on which the proposed restrictions are based and any comments submitted.

Deadlines are specified to ensure that the process is as fast as possible commensurate with the need for accuracy, fairness and a high level of protection for human health and the environment.

The opinion shall be prepared by a risk assessment rapporteur and shall be adopted by the Committee for Risk Assessment. This is to ensure that expertise available in the Agency in the field of risk assessment is fully brought to bear on the opinion.

Article 68 - Agency opinion: Committee for socio-economic analysis

This Article details the process that shall be followed within the Agency for the preparation of an opinion on the socio-economic impact of the proposed restrictions.

Deadlines are specified to ensure that the process is as fast as possible commensurate with the need for accuracy, fairness and a high level of protection for human health and the environment. The deadline is longer than that for the Committee for Risk Assessment so that their opinion can be taken into account.

The opinion shall be prepared by a socio-economic analysis rapporteur and shall be adopted by the Committee for socio-economic analysis. This is to ensure that expertise available in the Agency in the field of socio-economic analysis is fully brought to bear on the opinion.

It is recognised that many interested parties will either not have the resources or the information to prepare a full socio-economic analysis. For this reason, information that contributes to one may also be submitted for consideration by the Committee and its rapporteur.

Article 69 - Submission of an opinion to the Commission

This Article requires the Agency to give the opinions of the two Committees as well as any supporting material, if required, to the Commission so that it can make a proposal based on full information and the expert opinion of the two Agency Committees.

The article also requires the Agency to let the Commission know if either or both of the Committees have failed to develop an opinion within the deadlines given in Articles 67 and 68.

The opinions shall be published on the Agency's web-site in the interests of transparency and openness.

Article 70 - Commission decision

This Article requires the Commission to draft an amendment or addition to Annex XVI within 3 months of receiving the two opinions from the two Agency Committees or 3 months after the deadlines in Articles 67 and 68 if no opinion has been provided.

The deadline is provided to help ensure that proposals for restrictions are introduced as rapidly as is reasonably possible commensurate with the need for fairness, accuracy and a high level of protection for human health and the environment.

It is the responsibility of the Commission to consider the evidence from, and opinions of, the two Agency Committees. The Commission shall weigh up the evidence and make a proposal. The Commission may exceptionally come forward with a proposal that is not in accordance with the opinion of either Committee. In this case, the Commission shall make a detailed explanation of the proposal and the reasons for its differences with the opinions of the two Committees.

2.9. Agency

Article 71 - Establishment and responsibility of the Agency

This Article establishes the European Chemicals Agency which will contribute to a high level of protection of human health and the environment in the context of the operation of the internal market. The Agency is responsible for ensuring that it operates properly the tasks assigned to it by this regulation and for co-ordinating the resources of Member States competent authorities under the Reach system. This co-ordination role, as opposed to giving the Agency a role as a pan-European regulator, is consistent with the principle of subsidiarity.

Article 72 - Composition of the Agency

This Article sets out the structure of the Agency:

- the Management Board;

- the Executive Director;

- the Committee for Risk Assessment, which prepares the Agency's opinion on risks to human health and the environment under the authorisation and restriction procedures;

- the Committee for Socio-economic Analysis, which prepares the Agency's opinion on any question related to the socio-economic analysis of substances;

- the Member State Committee, which co-ordinates work on evaluation, classification and labelling and identification of substances of very high concern;

- the Forum on exchange of information on enforcement, which co-ordinates a network of Member States' enforcement authorities but does not prepare Agency opinions;

- the Secretariat to support the Committees and the Forum and to execute the administrative parts of the Reach system; and

- the Board of Appeal, which considers any appeals against the decisions of the Agency.

They are described in more detail below.

The second paragraph allows the Committees and the Forum to establish working groups. These could be used, for example, to prepare the work of a Committee under a particular procedure such as restrictions or to address specific technical issues. The Risk Assessment Committee has different, but related, tasks under the restrictions and authorisation procedures. It might be useful to establish working groups for each of these, while the Committee assures coherence between the approaches taken in each working group.

The third paragraph allows the Committees and the Forum to seek specialist advice from appropriate external sources as necessary.

Article 73 - Tasks of the Agency

This Article provides that the Agency shall advise the Member States and the Community within the context of the Reach System.

The second paragraph sets out the tasks to be performed by the Secretariat, without participation of the Committees. These tasks are essentially administrative, requiring a good understanding of the Reach system but limited technical expertise judgement, so it would be inappropriate to involve the Committees. Tasks (a)-(c) require dissemination of information to Member States and other interested parties. Task (d) provides for the establishment and maintenance of the database that is the primary store of information that will be available to the Competent Authorities as well as the source of non-confidential information to be made available on request. Task (e) requires the Agency to make publicly available information on which substances have been, and are, subject to evaluation. Task (f) requires the preparation of documents for companies concerning their obligations under the Reach system. As these documents are not expected to be highly technical, it is appropriate to allocate this task to the Secretariat. Task (g) establishes a help desk to support Member State competent authorities' own help desks. The Member States competent authorities' help desks provide advice to companies and the Agency's help desk promotes a harmonised approach by the Member States competent authorities. The Agency's help desk does not provide advice direct to industry because maintaining the language capabilities and knowledge of local conditions needed to respond to many thousands of potential enquiries in an enlarged Union would require a disproportionate investment of resources. Task (h) involves the preparation of descriptive documents to help non-industry stakeholders understand the Reach system.

The third paragraph sets out the tasks to be performed by the Committees. Tasks (a) to (e) provide for the work under the relevant procedures leading to the adoption of opinions or recommendations for substances to be included in Step 1 of authorisation or to be classified at Community level. Task (f) provides for technical support to Community participation in international harmonisation activities, since the Agency's expertise makes it the natural contact point in such work. Task (g) gives the Commission the right to request ad hoc opinions on specific issues related to the safety of substances.

The fourth paragraph sets out the work of the Forum. This is based largely on the work of the existing informal network of Member State competent authorities. The tasks are largely self-explanatory. The work of the Forum will be undertaken by the Member States' representatives with administrative and logistical support from the Agency. The Agency itself will not have a monitoring role with regard to enforcement. It is expected that the Forum will have an important role to play in assuring the effective working of the Reach system.

The fifth paragraph explains that the Board of Appeal shall decide appeals against any Agency decision.

Article 74 - Powers of the Management Board

This Article defines the powers of the Management Board in accordance with the principles laid out in the Commission Communication on the operating framework for European regulatory agencies.

Article 75 - Composition of the Management Board

This Article defines the composition of the Management Board in accordance with the principles laid out in the Commission Communication on the operating framework for European regulatory agencies.

Article 76 - Chairmanship of the Management Board

Article 77 - Meetings

Article 78 - Voting

These Articles are self-explanatory.

Article 79 - Duties and Powers of the Executive Director

This Article defines the powers of the Executive Director in accordance with the principles laid out in the Commission Communication on the operating framework for European regulatory agencies.

The tasks listed in the second paragraph are generally self-explanatory but certain points merit a little more discussion. Task (c) will require the Executive Director to follow closely the work of the Committees to ensure that they meet the deadlines set down in the legislation. The timely co-ordination of the work of the Committees under task (e) will in particular require that the Risk Assessment Committee provides timely information to the Socio-economic Committee and that the latter Committee provides timely feedback to the former.

The tasks in the third paragraph relate to annual activities on reporting, work planning, accounting and budget forecasting.

Article 80 - Appointment of the Executive Director

This Article provides a transparent procedure for the selection and appointment of a suitable candidate.

Article 81 - Establishment of the Committees

This Article provides that each Member State may nominate candidates to the Risk Assessment and Socio-economic Analysis Committees.. The Management Board will appoint at least one member from each Member State having made a nomination to that committee. The Member States shall appoint one member each to the Member State Committee. The members shall have the technical expertise relevant to the Committee on which they serve. It is intended that the members of the Risk Assessment and Socio-economic Analysis Committees shall give their views as experts and not as representatives of their Member State. It is nevertheless appropriate to draw the members from the Member States because this will give the Committees access to the collective expertise of the Member States, will promote mutual acceptance of decisions and so support the harmonisation of regulatory practices across the Community.

In order to provide a good range of expertise on each Committee, the Committees may co-opt up to five further members. Recognising that Committee members cannot have the expertise needed to discuss all issues that may come before a Committee, members may be accompanied by scientific and technical advisers having the expertise relevant to a particular item. Meetings of the Committees shall be open to the Commission and to the Executive Director of the Agency.

Committee members shall ensure appropriate co-ordination between the work of Member States competent authority and that of their Committee in order to promote a common European approach. In this context it is useful to note that members of the equivalent committees within the Emea spend around a quarter of their time at the Agency and the rest back in their Member State. It is expected that members of the Committees will spend at least a similar proportion of their time at the Agency.

The Member States are required to provide scientific and technical support to the work of the Committees and working groups. This is the Agency's primary means of "co-ordinating the scientific and technical resources put at its disposal by the Member States" as required in Article 71. Member States are not permitted to give instructions to members of the Risk Assessment Committee and of the Committee for Socio-Economic Analysis that might conflict with an objective scientific and technical analysis of the issues under discussion.

To facilitate the work of the committees, opinions may be adopted by a majority of Committee members, with due recording of minority views.

Article 82 - Establishment of the Forum

This Article provides that each Member State shall nominate a member to the Forum. The members shall have expertise relevant to the Forum. It is intended that the members shall give their views as experts and not as representatives of their Member State. In order to provide a good range of expertise on the Forum, it may co-opt up to five further members. Recognising that Forum members cannot have the expertise needed to discuss all issues that may come before it, members may be accompanied by scientific and technical advisers having the expertise relevant to a particular item.

Forum members shall ensure appropriate co-ordination between the work of Member State competent authority and that of the Forum in order to promote a common European approach to enforcement and to ensure that the Forum's work is informed by practical experience.

The third paragraph provides the Agency's primary means of "co-ordinating the scientific and technical resources put at its disposal by the Member States", here in particular by its competent authorities, as required in Article 71. The Member States are required to provide scientific and technical support to the work of the Forum and its working groups. They are not permitted to give instructions to Forum members that might conflict with an objective scientific and technical analysis of the issues under discussion. They are also required to monitor the quality and independence of the work of the Forum and its working groups to ensure that all members are fulfilling their role appropriately.

Article 83 - Rapporteurs of committees and use of experts

Rapporteurs may be appointed where a Committee's opinion is required under the evaluation, restrictions or authorisation procedures. A Committee may also appoint a co-rapporteur. This may prove particularly useful where the co-rapporteur has better access to expertise, perhaps within his Member State competent authority, related to a particular aspect of a dossier.

The Committees should develop the modalities for replacement of a rapporteur or co-rapporteur in their rules of procedure.

The third paragraph provides for contracts to pay for the work of rapporteurs, non-governmental experts serving on working groups and any expert performing other functions for the Agency. The Executive Director is responsible for managing such contracts. In this context, it should be noted that a rapporteur is not expected to work alone but rather to co-ordinate the work of a team of experts who prepare the report for the Committee.

The fourth paragraph provides, where appropriate, for calls for expressions of interest. This is not expected to be appropriate in the case of rapporteurs.

The fifth paragraph gives the Agency the discretion to engage experts to discharge other specific tasks. These could include cases where the Commission requests ad hoc opinions on specific issues, as provided for in Article 73(3)(f).

Article 84 - Qualification and interests of members of committees and boards

The identity and qualifications of members of Committees should be published in the interests of transparency. Members may request that their identity not be published if they are concerned for their personal safety. This is a concern in certain Member States for animal protection issues.

To ensure the provision of objective advice, servants of the Agency shall make declarations of interests and not discuss or vote on issues relating to those interests.

Article 85 - Establishment of the Board of Appeal

This Article sets out the membership of the Board of Appeal, how they shall be appointed and their voting rights.

Article 86 - Members of the Board of Appeal

This Article sets out the term of office of members of the Board of Appeal, who may serve on it, under what conditions they might be removed, and how potential conflicts of interest will be dealt with.

Article 87 - Decisions subject to appeal

This article explains that appeals can be brought against decisions taken:

- to reject a registration,

- to grant, reject or place conditions on an application for a PPORD exemption,

- under the evaluation provisions;

- to grant or reject a declaration that information be kept confidential, and

- to deny access to information.

Any decision being appealed against shall not apply until the appeal is considered.

Article 88 - Persons entitled to appeal, time limit and form

This Article provides that the person to whom a decision is directed has 1 month to appeal against that decision.

Article 89 - Examination and decisions on appeal

Decisions on appeals shall be made within 30 days. Those involved in the appeal shall have the right to present their case to the Board.

Article 90 - Actions before the Court of Justice

Appeals against the decisions of the Board of Appeal, or proceedings against the Agency for failing to make a decision, can be made to the Court of Justice. The Agency has to comply with the judgement of the Court of Justice.

Article 91 - Complaints to the ombudsman

This article is necessary to make the provisions on the Agency consistent with Article 195 of the EC Treaty.

Article 92 - Conflicts of opinion with other bodies

Other agencies, particularly Emea and Efsa, have responsibilities that relate to those of the Agency. It is conceivable that these other agencies may adopt opinions related to certain substances that differ from those of the Agency. This Article therefore provides a mechanism for resolution of such differences. Similarly, there are Community scientific committees that may be called on to provide opinions that relate to substances and so this mechanism applies to them also. The relationship of Member State competent authorities to the Agency is extensively addressed in the Reach system and so it would be inappropriate for this mechanism to apply to them. Relevant national bodies within individual Member States are also not covered, since Member State competent authorities are expected to consider the views of such bodies in formulating their own views.

Article 93 - The budget of the Agency

This Article sets out the provisions related to the establishment of the budget of the Community Agency. The budget will be funded through a Community subsidy, through fees collected, more particularly for registration and authorisation, and through voluntary contributions from Member States. All substances produced or imported in volumes starting at 100t are subject to evaluation and so a higher fee for registration of such substances is charged to fund this evaluation work. Other substances may be subjected to evaluation on the initiative of authorities but it would be inappropriate to charge a fee to industry for this. Similarly it would be inappropriate to charge a fee when a restrictions procedure is started. These and other activities of the Agency will be funded from a general reserve drawn from the basic registration fee and from the subsidy from the Community budget.

The Commission proposes that the Community subsidy should, over a number of years, approximate to the cost to the Community budget under existing legislation of supporting the European Chemicals Bureau. It is important to note that the Community subsidy will vary substantially over the first decade of the Agency's life while substances are phased into the system. This is because the registration deadlines for phase-in substances will yield very large fee incomes in certain years but relatively little in others.

Article 94 - Implementation of the Agency's budget

This Article sets out the standard provisions related to the implementation of the budget of a Community Agency.

Article 95 - Fees

This Article empowers the Management Board to set and adjust the fees to be paid by industry to fund the work of the Agency. This will assist the Agency in balancing its budget in the light of experience with the operation of the Reach system. This is to allow the costs incurred by the Agency under the respective parts of this Regulation to be reflected in the fee structure.

Article 96 - Combating fraud

This Article sets out standard provisions related to combating fraud.

Article 97 - Financial regulation

This Article sets out standard provisions concerning the adoption of the Agency's financial Regulation.

Article 98 - Legal personality and seat of the Agency

This Article grants legal personality to the Agency, allowing it to buy and sell property, start legal proceedings and so forth.

Under the present chemicals legislation, the European Chemicals Bureau of the Commission's Joint Research Centre fulfils a role analogous to that of the Agency. It will be the centre of the Commission's detailed preparatory work for the Reach system and, immediately following the entry into force of the Reach system, it will temporarily fulfil the role of the Agency. Given the importance of continuity in chemicals regulation and the Agency's need to recruit quickly a core of experienced staff, the Commission proposes that the Agency should have its seat in the same location as the present European Chemicals Bureau.

Article 99 - Liability of the Agency

This Article sets out standard provisions related to the liability of the Agency and gives the Court of Justice jurisdiction over disputes or arbitration. For the liability of servants towards the Agency reference is made to Article 101.

Article 100 - Privileges and immunities of the Agency

This Article accords the Agency the privileges and immunities applicable to the European Communities.

Article 101 - Staff rules and regulations

This Article subjects the staff of the Agency to the rules and regulations applicable to officials and other staff of the European Communities and nominates the Agency as the appointing authority within the meaning of those staff rules and regulations. The Management Board, in agreement with the Commission, is enabled to adopt the necessary implementing provisions.

Article 102 - Duty of confidentiality

This Article imposes a normal duty of confidentiality on servants of the Agency.

Article 103 - Participation of third countries

This Article provides for the participation of third countries in the work of the Agency. They may participate to a degree that the Agency deems appropriate for a particular country at a particular time. This may be useful in, for example, preparing candidate countries for their future role as Member States or in promoting co-operation with members of the European Economic Area.

Article 104 - International harmonisation of regulations

This Article provides for international organisations having interests in the harmonisation of international regulations to participate as observers in the work of the Agency. The aim is to provide a focus for Community input to such activities. The Agency will agree on the terms for such participation.

Article 105 - Contacts with stakeholder organisations

This Article provides for the involvement of industry, consumer protection, worker protection and environmental protection organisations in the work of the Agency. The aim is to promote transparency and so secure widespread acceptance of the work of the Agency among key stakeholders.

Article 106 - Rules on transparency

This article provides for rules to ensure that the Agency operates in an appropriately transparent manner. The rules will be subject to approval by the Agency and the Commission.

Article 107 - Relations with relevant Community bodies

This Article provides that there should be no duplication of competences between the Agency and the European Food Safety Authority, the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products or the Commission's Advisory Committee on Safety, Hygiene and Health Protection at Work. In view of the need to ensure effective co-operation with the European Food Safety Authority on substances that are used in plant protection products the Executive Director is required to develop rules of procedure for co-operation. There is also a need for co-operation on worker protection issues with the Advisory Committee and so the Executive Director is again required to develop rules of procedure.

The Commission and the Agency shall consider the possibility of exchanging staff with a view to enhancing understanding of their respective roles under this Regulation.

Article 108 - Formats and software for submission of information to the Agency

To aid the efficient operation of the Reach system and to help actors in the supply chain meet their duties under Reach, formats for submitting information will be made available free of charge and software packages will be made available on the Internet.

2.10. Classification and Labelling Inventory

Article 109 - Scope

This Article outlines what the Title applies to.

Article 110 - Obligation to notify the Agency

This Article specifies the information that must be provided by all those who place substances on the market. As the duty to classify and label already applies to all substances placed on the market, this information shall be required from the first phase-in deadline (three years after entry into force of the Regulation). Classification and labelling data are part of the normal information requirements for registration. Therefore, if a registration was already submitted, there is no need to notify the information again. Subsequently, if further information comes to light, as a result of the Reach system or otherwise, the entry shall be updated. It is anticipated that for some substances the classifications notified or registered will vary. Over time it is expected that notifiers and registrants will work together to agree an entry.

Article 111 - The classification and labelling inventory

This Article details the information that will be included in the inventory. This inventory will be widely available as a source of information on substances and also act as an encouragement to industry to harmonise their classification and labelling proposals when entries for the same substance differ.

Article 112 - Harmonisation of classification and labelling

This Article specifies that once the Regulation comes into force only substances having one or more of certain dangerous properties may be added to Annex I of Directive 67/548/EEC. The purpose of this requirement is to concentrate resources on looking at the classification of those substances with properties of very high concern. The other provisions of the Regulation should adequately deal with properties of lesser concern.

Article 113 - Transitional arrangements

All substances placed on the market are subject to classification and labelling requirements. Notifications to the Agency for the classification and labelling inventory can therefore to be made rather quickly, at the date of the first phase-in deadline.

2.11. Information

Article 114 - Reporting

The Regulation will introduce a new and comprehensive system for the management of industrial chemicals. It is necessary therefore for the operation of the system to be monitored at the levels of the Member State, the Agency and the Commission so that issues and problems can be identified. This establishes the need for all Member States, the Agency and the Commission to report on the operation of all aspects of the Regulation.

Article 115 -Access to information

One of the objectives of the new system is to make information on chemicals more widely available. Some items are published and freely available in accordance with Article 74(2)(d). Certain non-confidential information shall be made available by the Agency on request in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 but when such a request for access is made, the third parties concerned by this information may submit a declaration asking that it be kept confidential. For this it has to justify that disclosure of the information could actually harm him commercially. Appropriate procedures are foreseen. Directive 2003/4/EC applies to requests to obtain information from Member State Competent Authorities, but if the data concerned come from the Agency, it is the Agency who decides whether access can be granted.

Article 116 - Confidentiality

This Article identifies what information shall not be treated as confidential and hence is made available on the database, and what shall always be automatically treated as confidential and hence will not be made available. All other information may be claimed to be confidential in accordance with Article 115(2) if it can be demonstrated that disclosure of the information could actually harm the party concerned commercially. The minimum information required to adequately control a substance cannot be kept confidential, including basic information on the hazards of a substance, guidance on safe use, those elements of the safety data sheet not considered to be confidential and information needed to identify the substance.

Article 117 - Cooperation with third countries and international organisations

This Article allows data held by the Agency to be exchanged, under appropriate confidentiality arrangements, with third countries or international organisations fulfilling tasks under legislation similar to Reach. This is in order to avoid duplication of work internationally and to share experience. Any such arrangement has to be in compliance with the EC Treaty.

2.12. Competent authorities

Article 118 - Appointment of competent authorities

In order to ensure that competent authorities are able to fulfil the duties allocated to them under the Reach system, this article requires Member States to create such authorities and to allocate them sufficient resources to perform their duties.

Article 119 - Co-operation between competent authorities

Co-operation between competent authorities is important to the good functioning of the Reach system.

Article 120 - Public communication of information on risks of substances

In certain cases, the provision of information to the public may be the most appropriate risk management measure. Member State competent authorities, rather than the Agency, are the appropriate bodies to provide such information given the importance of cultural and linguistic elements in a successful information campaign.

Article 121 - Other responsibilities of the competent authorities

Given that the Reach system places a number of new obligations on industry, it is important that companies, especially small and medium sized enterprises, know where to go for advice. Many competent authorities already offer advice to industry but this article formalises that requirement. It is expected that competent authorities will create help desks, with appropriate information available on-line. It is appropriate to give this task to competent authorities rather than the Agency because they have the language capabilities and knowledge of local conditions needed to respond effectively.

2.13. Enforcement

Article 122 - Tasks of the Member States

This requires the Member States to establish appropriate approaches to enforcement of the Regulation. The experience of the Chemical Legislation European Enforcement Network (Cleen) with activities looking at the enforcement of various pieces of chemical legislation across a number of Member States will be a valuable resource in establishing such approaches. The Forum to be set-up under the auspices of the Agency will continue the work of Cleen in developing a consistent approach to the enforcement of chemicals legislation through controls and other activities.

Article 123 - Sanctions for non-compliance

This requires the Member States to establish sanctions for non-compliance with this Regulation. The sanctions imposed must be proportionate to the extent and impact of the non-compliance. The experience of Cleen points to the need to harmonise to some degree the sanctions imposed, taking account the need for subsidiarity. The Forum should enable Member States to establish a coherent approach to sanctions.

Article 124 - Report

This requires Member States to report on their enforcement activities and the sanctions imposed for non-compliance over the previous calendar year. This information will be useful to the Forum in identifying any action that might usefully be taken.

2.14. Transitional and final provisions

Article 125 - Free Movement Clause

This is the explicit complement to the various requirements in the Regulation and covers those substances on their own, in preparations, or in articles that are complying with the provisions of the Regulation.

Article 126 - Safeguard clause

Despite the thorough and far reaching nature of the Regulation it is possible that effects of a substance may be identified by a Member State that need to be addressed urgently.

Article 127 - Motivation of decisions

In the interests of transparency and legal certainty, the reasons for all decisions taken by the various authorities must be given.

Article 128 - Amendments to the annexes

This enables the Commission to revise Annexes I to XVII to the Regulation through a Committee procedure, as these relate to scientific and technical matters and do not touch the fundamental rules established in the body of the Regulation.

Article 129 - Implementing legislation

This enables the Commission to complement the Regulation through the Comitology procedure. This is essential to enable the Commission to adopt measures that will ensure that the implementation of Reach can be carried through efficiently.

Article 130 - Committee procedure

Two Committee procedures are proposed: the advisory committee and the regulatory committee as established under Decision 1999/468/EC. The committee procedure proposed in particular articles of the regulation depends on the measure to be taken, i.e. the advisory procedure for individual decisions and the regulatory procedure for measures of general application.

Article 131 - Transitional measures regarding the Agency

For some of the provisions in the Regulation to act as anticipated, a managing body must be operational from the day the Regulation comes into force. Until the Agency becomes operational, the Commission fulfils this role, especially in respect of appointment of personnel.

Article 132 - Transitional measures regarding restrictions

Extensive work has been performed under Directive 76/769/EEC and Regulation (EEC) No 793/93. It is likely that some of that restrictions identified in these pieces of legislation will not have been taken all the way through to a Commission decision before this Regulation comes into force, including repealing Directive 76/769/EEC and Regulation (EEC) No 793/93. This enables such restrictions to still be brought forward and implemented without having to go through all the new procedures set out in this Regulation.

Article 133 - Review

This Regulation carefully balances workability with the need to protect human health and the environment and maintain and enhance the competitiveness of EU industry. The first paragraph of this Article sets out the requirement for the Commission to review 12 years after the Regulation comes into force whether the CSA requirements in this Regulation are adequate or whether it is necessary to extend them to substances manufactured or imported in quantities of less than 10 tonnes per year, and to amend the Regulation accordingly. Paragraph 2 contains the review and adaptation provision discussed above under section 2.2, with regard to Articles 14 and 37. Similarly, paragraph 3 provides for review and possible modification of information requirements for substances of 1 tonne or more, but less than 10 tonnes per year.

Article 134 - Repeal

This establishes which Directives and Regulations are to be replaced by this Regulation that covers their relevant provisions.

Articles 135 and 136 Amendments

These Articles contain consequential amendments to Directive 1999/45/EC and to Regulation (EC) No .../...[POPs]

Article 137 - Entry into Force and Application

This establishes when the Regulation enters into force and when the duties under various parts of the Regulation apply. Not all duties apply when the Regulation first enters into force because other duties may need to be met first.

The Registration provisions shall apply 60 days after the Regulation enters into force so that the Commission and the Agency has sufficient time to ensure all the systems are in place to receive registrations. It is also undesirable to postpone the registration provisions too long as this would prevent new substances coming onto the market.

The provisions in Articles 81 and 82 applying to the risk assessment and socio-economic analysis committees and the Forum apply one year after the Regulation enters into force to allow for the appointment of an Executive Director, a number of other personnel, to informally convene the Committees and the Forum, and to discuss working methods.

The restrictions provisions in Articles 66 to 70 apply 18 months after the Regulation enters into force to ensure that the necessary Committees are in place. The Commission can use Article 132 to bring in restrictions based on existing work.

The provisions for substance evaluation apply two years after the Regulation enters into force when it is likely that a number of registrations will be available for substance evaluation.

3. Annexes

Annex I - General provisions for assessing substances and preparing chemical safety reports

Together with safety data sheets, the Chemical Safety Report will be a key tool for development of risk assessments under Directive 98/24/EC on the protection of the health and safety of workers from the risks related to chemical agents at work. In consultation with stakeholders, the Commission will investigate how the assessment requirements under Directive 98/24/EC and those of the Reach system can be made compatible with respect to guidance and software.

Annex Ia - Guide to the compilation of safety data sheets

The safety data sheet is the main tool used in industry for communicating information on the risks of dangerous substances and preparations through the supply chain. Annex Ia is the old annex to the safety data sheet Directive (91/155/EEC) that explains what information should be included under each of the 16 safety data sheet headings. It has been integrated with the concept of chemical safety assessments and chemical safety reports introduced by Reach. The CSR developed in accordance with Annex I, and in particular the exposure scenarios, should be used to complete the safety data sheet.

Annex Ib - Chemical Safety Assessments for Preparations

This short Annex sets out a methodology for undertaking chemical safety assessments for preparations. This differs in a number of technical aspects from the methodology used for substances, set out in Annex I. Chemical safety assessments for preparations are permitted by article 30(2).

Annex II - Exemptions from obligation to register in accordance with Article 4(2)(a)

Annex II and III list substances that are exempted from registration based on current practice. This Annex exempts individual substances following historical precedent.

Annex III - Exemptions from obligation to register in accordance with Article 4(2)(b)

This Annex lists types of substances for which registration would be inappropriate.

Annex IV - Information requirements referred to in Article 9

Annex IV contains a guidance note on how to use Annexes IV to IX, and sets out the basic information required on: general registrant information, identity of substance, information on manufacture and use(s) of the substance(s), and guidance on safe use.

Annex V - Standard information requirements for substances manufactured or imported in quantities of 1 tonne or more

Annex VI - Additional standard information requirements for substances manufactured or imported in quantities of 10 tonnes or more

Annex VII - Additional standard information requirements for substances manufactured or imported in quantities of 100 tonnes or more

Annex VIII - Additional standard information requirements for substances manufactured or imported in quantities of 1000 tonnes or more

Annex IX - General rules for adaptation of the standard testing regime set out in Annexes V to VIII

Progressively more information is required on a substance with increasing tonnage, with only Annex V required for lower tonnages and V-VIII for the highest.

Annexes V-VIII contain specific rules concerning the applicability of individual information requirements, which aim to ensure both that no unnecessary information is required and that registrants are required to consider when further information is appropriate. Annex IX sets out more general rules concerning the adaptation of the specific rules in Annexes V to VIII.

Annex X - Testing methods

This Annex takes over the testing methods currently contained in Directive 67/548/EEC.

Annex XI - General Provisions for Downstream Users to assess substances and prepare Chemical Safety Reports

Annex XI sets out a clear methodology that enables downstream users to undertake chemical safety assessments and prepare chemical safety reports for uses that they make of a substance that are not covered by the safety data sheet supplied to them. Downstream users will use the information provided by their suppliers via the safety data sheet and information from other sources to develop (an) exposure scenario(s), and, if necessary, refine the hazard assessment or risk characterisation, for their own use, or other uses down the supply chain.

Annex XII - Criteria for the identification of persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic substances, and very persistent and very bioaccumulative substances

This Annex sets out the identification criteria for PBTs and vPvBs.

Annex XIII - List of substances subject to authorisation

This Annex will contain the substances for which uses have to be authorised, specifying the information set out in Article 55.

Annex XIV - Dossiers

This Annex sets out the requirements for a proposal for any restriction, as well as proposals for harmonised classification and labelling, and the identification of substances as PBT, VPVB or of equivalent concern.

Any proposal has to be based on a risk assessment following the relevant sections of Annex I, and has to justify why action at Community level is necessary.

These requirements are specified to ensure that adequate information is available for interested parties to comment on the risk assessment and the associated proposed restrictions and for the Agency's Committees to develop an informed opinion.

This Annex was considered to be necessary because risk assessments submitted to the Commission were of such variable consistency and content that it was difficult to make considered decisions based on them. This meant that risk assessments sometimes had to be repeated resulting in a considerable delay to restrictions being introduced.

Annex XV - Socio-Economic Analysis

This Annex outlines such of the issues that may be addressed in a socio-economic analysis, or information that could be provided by interested parties to help the Agency's Socio-Economic Analysis Committee develop an opinion.

The Annex does not specify requirements because socio-economic analyses can be carried out on a range of levels (e.g. international, national, regional, local) and to address a wide variety of impacts (e.g. social, consumer, industry) and it was considered that no one set of requirements could meet all these needs.

The socio-economic analysis or contribution to it, is therefore the responsibility of the person submitting the information. They must decide on the most appropriate methodology to take and information to submit.

It is possible that with experience the Agency's Socio-Economic Analysis Committee may be able to recommend to the Commission more precise requirements for inclusion in this Annex.

Annex XVI - Restrictions on the manufacture, placing on the market and use of certain dangerous substances, preparations and articles

This Annex lists all the substances which are subject to restrictions and indicates the nature of the restrictions for these substances on their own, in preparations or in articles. These restrictions may be either conditions for the manufacture, use or the placing on the market or prohibitions of any of these activities. The restrictions in this Annex are essentially those carried over from Directive 76/769/EEC. That Directive will be repealed with the entry into force of this Regulation. Over the coming years the Annex will be revised as new restrictions are adopted following the provisions of this Regulation.

Annex XVI follows the rules set out within the Inter Institutional Agreement concerning recasting techniques (OJ C 77/1, 28.03.2002). Annex XVI has been drawn up in order to recast the legislation dealing with restriction of chemicals, Directive 76/769/EEC that has been adapted or amended many times.

The recast presented in Annex XVI does not intend to bring about changes of substance to the text. In particular, Annex XVI does not contain any additions of substances not previously restricted under Directive 76/769/EEC.

However, a number of minor changes were introduced (highlighted with adaptation markers), e.g. with the objective of harmonising the presentation with that of Directive 67/548/EEC. This applies to entry nos. 26, 31a, 31b, 31c, 31d, 31e, 31g, 31i, 33, 39. Some of these minor changes have been added in order to improve the readability of the text. This applies to entries 6.1, 6.2, and 23.1. It is also the case for entries 28, 29 and 30 (ex entries 29, 30 and 31) that have been merged into one block because their respective provisions are similar. Consequently, redundant provisions have been deleted.

Some deletions have been introduced in order to update the text and withdraw for example old date references. It applies for example to entries 1.1(a), 1.1(b), 1.1(c), 1.1(d), 1.1.e, 1.5, 18.2, 23.1.2, 23.4, 24.1, 24.2.(a), 24.3, 42.2. Some additions have also been included in order to update references to several directives quoted in the consolidated text. This applies for example to entries 3, 5.3.(a), 5.3(c), 12(1), 28, 29 and 30 (paragraphs 1 and 2) and 32.

A few changes became necessary for PCB because the substance in question was included in Annex XVII instead of Annex XVI as a result of the Persistent Organic pollutants Convention (so called "POPs convention"). This concerns entries 1(c), 1.4 and 1.6.

In some cases, changes were introduced because the Regulation addresses itself to operators instead of Member States. This applies for example to entries 1.6 and Appendix 7 (point 7).

Annex XVII - Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs)

This Annex will list all the substances and the details of restrictions from the Stockholm Convention and the UN ECE Protocol on Persistent Organic Pollutants. By including these restrictions in this Annex and thereby in Community law, the European Community fulfils part of its obligation under the international Convention.

2003/0256(COD)

Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (Reach), establishing a European Chemicals Agency and amending Directive 1999/45/EC and Regulation (EC) No .../... {on Persistent Organic Pollutants}

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 95 thereof,

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission [4],

[4] OJ C

Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee [5],

[5] OJ C

Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty [6],

[6] OJ C

Whereas:

(1) The free movement of substances, on their own, in preparations and in articles, is an essential aspect of the internal market and contributes significantly to the health and well-being of consumers and workers, and to their social and economic interests, as well as to the competitiveness of the chemical industry.

(2) The efficient functioning of the internal market for substances within the Community can be achieved only if requirements for substances do not differ significantly from Member State to Member State.

(3) A high level of health and environmental protection should be ensured in the approximation of legislation on substances, with the goal of achieving sustainable development; that legislation should be applied in a non-discriminatory manner whether chemical substances are traded on the internal market or internationally.

(4) To preserve the integrity of the internal market and ensure a high level of protection for human health, especially the health of workers, and the environment, it is necessary to ensure that substances manufactured in the Community comply with Community law, even if they are exported.

(5) The assessment [7] of the operation of the four main legal instruments governing chemicals in the Community (Council Directive 67/548/EEC of 27 June 1967 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances [8], Council Directive 88/379/EEC of 7 June 1988 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous preparations [9] (in the meantime replaced by Directive 1999/45/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 May 1999 concerning the approximation of the law, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous preparations [10]), Council Regulation (EEC) No 793/93 of 23 March 1993 on the evaluation and control of the risks of existing substances [11] and Council Directive 76/769/EEC of 27 July 1976 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to restrictions on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations [12]) identified a number of problems in the functioning of Community legislation on chemicals, resulting in disparities between the laws, regulations and administrative provisions in Member States directly affecting the functioning of the internal market in this field.

(6) Substances under customs supervision which are in temporary storage, in free zones or free warehouses with a view to re-exportation or in transit are not used within the meaning of this Regulation and are therefore to be excluded from its scope.

(7) An important objective of the new system to be established by this Regulation is to encourage the substitution of dangerous substances by less dangerous substances or technologies where suitable alternatives are available. This Regulation does not affect the application of Directives on worker protection, especially Council Directive 90/394/EEC of 28 June 1990 on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to carcinogens at work (Sixth individual Directive within the meaning of Article 16(1) of Directive 89/391/EEC) [13] under which employers are required to eliminate dangerous substances, wherever technically possible, or to substitute dangerous substances with less dangerous substances.

[13] OJ L196, 26.7.1990, p. 1. Directive as last amended by Directive 1999/38/EC (OJ L 138, 1.6.1999, p. 66).

(8) Responsibility for the management of the risks of substances should lie with the enterprises that manufacture, import, place on the market or use these substances.

(9) For these reasons, the registration provisions require manufacturers and importers to generate data on the substances they manufacture or import, use these data to assess the risks related to these substances and to develop and recommend appropriate risk management measures. To ensure that they actually meet these obligations, as well as for transparency reasons, registration requires them to submit a dossier containing all this information to the Agency to be established by this Regulation. Registered substances should be allowed to circulate on the internal market.

(10) The evaluation provisions provide for follow-up to registration, by checking that registrations are in compliance with the requirement of this Regulation and by allowing for generation of more information on the properties of substances. Member States should evaluate such substances if they have reasons for suspecting that such substances present a risk to health or the environment, after having included them in their rolling plans.

(11) Although the information yielded on substances through evaluation should be used in the first place by manufacturers and importers to manage the risks related to their substances, it may be used to initiate the authorisation or restrictions procedures under this Regulation or risk management procedures under other Community legislation; therefore it should be ensured that this information is available to the appropriate authorities and may be used by them for the purpose of such procedures.

(12) The authorisation provisions provide for authorisations for the placing on the market and use of substances of very high concern to be granted by the Commission if the risks arising from their use are adequately controlled or the use can be justified for socio-economic reasons.

(13) The restrictions provisions allow the manufacturing, placing on the market and use of substances presenting risks that need to be addressed, to be made subject to total or partial bans or other restrictions, based on an assessment of those risks.

(14) There is a need to assure effective management of the technical, scientific and administrative aspects of the present Regulation at Community level. A central entity should therefore be created to fulfil this role.

(15) A feasibility study on the resource requirements for a central entity concluded that an independent central entity offered a number of long-term advantages over other options. A European Chemicals Agency, hereinafter referred to as "the Agency", should therefore be established.

(16) Experience has shown that it is inappropriate to require Member States to assess the risks of all chemical substances. This responsibility should therefore be given, in the first place, to the enterprises that manufacture or import substances, but only when they do so in quantities exceeding a certain volume, to enable them to carry the associated burden. Those enterprises should take the necessary risk management measures in accordance with their assessment of the risks of their substances.

(17) In order to undertake chemical safety assessments of substances effectively, manufacturers and importers of substances should obtain information on these substances, if necessary by performing new tests.

(18) For purposes of enforcement and evaluation and for reasons of transparency, the information on these substances, as well as related information, including on risk management measures, should be submitted to authorities, except in defined cases where such submission would be disproportionate.

(19) Scientific research and development normally takes place in quantities below 1 tonne per year, there is no need to exempt such research and development because substances in those quantities do not have to be registered in any case. However, in order to encourage innovation, research on products and process oriented research and development should be exempted from the obligation to register for a certain time period where a substance is not yet intended to be placed on the market to an indefinite number of customers because its application in preparations or articles still requires further research and development performed by a limited number of known customers.

(20) Since producers and importers of articles should be responsible for their articles, it is appropriate to impose a registration requirement on substances which are intended to be released from articles. In the case of substances which are likely to be released from articles in sufficiently high amounts and in such a way as to adversely affect human health or the environment, the Agency should be notified and should be empowered to request that a registration be submitted.

(21) The requirements for undertaking chemical safety assessments by manufacturers and importers should be prescribed in detail in a technical annex to allow them to meet their obligations. To achieve fair burden sharing with their customers, manufacturers and importers should in their chemical safety assessment address not only their own uses and the uses for which they place their substances on the market, but also all uses which their customers ask them to address.

(22) A chemical safety assessment should not need to be performed for substances in preparations in certain very small concentrations which are considered as not giving rise to concern. Substances in preparations in such low concentrations should also be exempt from authorisation. These provisions should apply equally to preparations that are solid mixtures of substances until a specific shape is given to such a preparation that transforms it into an article.

(23) One of a group of multiple registrants should be allowed to submit information on behalf of the others according to rules which ensure that all the required information is submitted, while allowing sharing of the costs burden.

(24) Requirements for generation of information on substances should be tiered according to the volume of manufacture or importation of a substance, because these provide an indication of the potential for exposure of man and the environment to the substances, and should be described in detail.

(25) If tests are performed, they should comply with the relevant requirements of protection of laboratory animals, set out in Council Directive 86/609/EEC of 24 November 1986 on the approximation of laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States regarding the protection of animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes [14], and good laboratory practice, set out in Council Directive 87/18/EEC of 18 December 1986 on the harmonisation of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the application of the principles of good laboratory practice and the verification of their application for tests on chemical substances [15].

[14] OJ L 358, 18.12.1986, p. 1. Directive as amended by Directive 2003/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 230, 16.9.2003, p. 32).

[15] OJ L 15, 17.1.1987, p. 29. Directive as amended by Commission Directive 1999/11/EC (OJ L 77, 23.3.1999, p. 8).

(26) The generation of information by alternative means offering equivalence to prescribed tests and test methods should also be allowed, for example when this information comes from valid qualitative or quantitative structure activity models or from structurally related substances. To this end the Agency, in cooperation with Member States and interested parties, should develop appropriate guidance. It should also be possible not to submit certain information if appropriate justification can be provided.

(27) Prescribed test methods should be consolidated for reasons of transparency as well as to facilitate good application of the requirements by enterprises.

(28) For reasons of workability and because of their special nature, specific registration requirements should be laid down for intermediates; polymers should be exempted from registration and evaluation until those that need to be registered due to the risks posed to human health or the environment can be selected in a practicable and cost-efficient way on the basis of sound technical and valid scientific criteria.

(29) To avoid overloading authorities and enterprises with the work arising from the registration of substances already on the internal market, that registration should be spread over an appropriate period of time, without introducing undue delay. Deadlines for the registration of these substances should therefore be set.

(30) Data for substances already notified in accordance with Directive 67/548/EEC should be eased into the system and should be upgraded when the next tonnage quantity threshold is reached.

(31) In order to provide a harmonised, simple system, all registrations should be submitted to the Agency. To ensure a consistent approach and efficient use of resources, it should perform a completeness check on all registrations and take responsibility for any final rejections of registrations.

(32) To ensure that the information available to the authorities is kept up-to-date, an obligation to inform the Agency of certain changes to the information should be introduced.

(33) The sharing and joint submission of information should be encouraged to increase the efficiency of this Regulation throughout the Community.

(34) It is appropriate to reduce to a minimum the number of vertebrate animals used for experimental purposes in accordance with the provisions of Directive 86/609/EEC; wherever possible the use of animals should be avoided by recourse to alternative methods validated by the European Centre for Validation of Alternative Testing Methods or other international bodies.

(35) This Regulation should be without prejudice to the full and complete application of the Community competition rules.

(36) In order to avoid duplication of work, and in particular to reduce testing involving vertebrate animals, the requirements concerning preparation and submission of registrations and updates should encourage registrants to check the databases established at the Agency and to take all reasonable steps to reach an agreement on the sharing of information.

(37) It is in the public interest to ensure the quickest possible circulation of test results on the human health or environmental hazards of certain substances to those enterprises which use them, in order to limit any risks associated with their use. Sharing of information should therefore be encouraged, under conditions that ensure a fair recompense for the company that has undertaken the tests.

(38) In order to respect the legitimate property rights of those generating testing data, the generator of such data should, for a period of 10 years, be able to claim compensation from those registrants who benefit from that data.

(39) In order to allow a potential registrant to proceed with his registration, even if he cannot reach agreement with a previous registrant, the Agency, on request, should make available any summary or robust study summary of tests already submitted. The registrant who receives these data should be obliged to pay a contribution to the costs to the generator of the data.

(40) In order to avoid duplication of work, and in particular to avoid duplication of testing, registrants of phase-in substances should pre-register as early as possible with a database managed by the Agency. A system should be established in order to help registrants to find other registrants and form consortia. In order to ensure the smooth functioning of that system they should fulfil certain obligations. If a member of a substance information exchange forum (SIEF) does not fulfil his obligations, he is breaching the Regulation and should be penalised accordingly but other members should be enabled to continue preparing their own registration.

(41) Part of the responsibility for the management of the risks of substances is the communication of information on these substances to other professionals; this is also indispensable for those others to meet their responsibility.

(42) As the existing safety data sheet is already being used as a communication tool within the supply chain of substances and preparations, it is appropriate to develop it further and make it an integral part of the system established by this Regulation.

(43) In order to have a chain of responsibilities, downstream users should be responsible for assessing the risks arising from their uses of substances if those uses are not covered by a safety data sheet received from their suppliers, unless the downstream user concerned takes more protective measures than those recommended by his supplier or unless his supplier was not required to assess those risks or provide him with information on those risks; for the same reason, downstream users should manage the risks arising from their uses of substances.

(44) The requirements for undertaking chemical safety assessments by downstream users should also be prescribed in detail to allow them to meet their obligations.

(45) For enforcement and evaluation purposes, downstream users of substances should be required to report certain information if their use is outside the conditions of the exposure scenario detailed in the safety data sheet communicated by their original manufacturer or importer and to keep such reported information up-to-date.

(46) For reasons of workability and proportionality, it is appropriate to exempt downstream users using low quantities of a substance from such reporting.

(47) A significant number of animals would have to be used in testing to fulfil the more demanding information requirements in respect of certain substances, if those information requirements were automatically applied. Significant costs for enterprises may be associated with testing. It is therefore necessary to ensure that generation of such information is tailored to real information needs; to this end evaluation should require Member States to prepare decisions and the Agency to decide on the programmes of testing proposed by manufacturers and importers for such substances. The Member State in which the manufacture takes place or the importer is established should be responsible for the evaluation of testing proposals.

(48) In addition, it is necessary to instil confidence in the general quality of registrations and to ensure that the public at large as well as all stakeholders in the chemicals industry have confidence that enterprises are meeting the obligations placed upon them; accordingly, it is appropriate that the same Member State be empowered to check the compliance of registrations submitted to this end.

(49) The Agency should also be empowered to require further information from manufacturers, importers or downstream users on substances suspected of posing a risk to health or the environment, including by reason of their presence on the internal market in high volumes, on the basis of evaluations performed by Member State competent authorities. Member States should be made to plan and provide resources to this end, through the establishment of rolling plans. If a risk equivalent to the level of concern arising from the use of substances subject to authorisation arises from the use of isolated intermediates on site, Member States should also be allowed to require further information, when justified.

(50) Collective agreement among Member State authorities on their draft decisions provides the basis for an efficient system that respects the principle of subsidiarity, while maintaining the internal market. If one or more Member States or the Agency do not agree to a draft decision, it should be made subject to a centralised procedure. The Agency should take the decisions following from the application of these procedures.

(51) Evaluation may lead to the conclusion that action should be taken under the restriction or authorisation procedures or that risk management action should be considered in the framework of other appropriate legislation. Information on the progress of evaluation proceedings should therefore be made public.

(52) To ensure a sufficiently high level of protection for human health and the environment, substances with properties of very high concern should be treated in a precautionary manner which requires enterprises using them to demonstrate to the granting authority that the risks are adequately controlled. If this is not the case, uses may still be authorised if enterprises show that the benefits to society from the use of the substance outweigh the risks connected with its use and there are no suitable alternative substances or technologies. The granting authority should then verify that these requirements are met through an authorisation procedure on the basis of applications by enterprises. Since authorisations should ensure a high level of protection throughout the internal market, it is appropriate that the Commission should be the granting authority.

(53) Experience at the international level shows that substances with characteristics rendering them persistent, liable to bioaccumulate and toxic, or very persistent and very liable to bioaccumulate, present a very high concern, while criteria have been developed allowing the identification of such substances. For certain other substances concerns are sufficiently high to address them in the same way on a case-by-case basis.

(54) In view of workability and practicality considerations, both as regards enterprises, who have to prepare application files and take appropriate risk management measures, and as regards the authorities, who have to process authorisation applications, only a limited number of substances should be subjected to the authorisation procedure at the same time and realistic deadlines should be set for applications, while allowing certain uses to be exempted.

(55) The Agency should provide advice on the prioritisation of substances to be made subject to the authorisation procedure, to ensure that decisions reflect the needs of society as well as scientific knowledge and developments.

(56) A total ban on a substance would mean that none of its uses could be authorised. It would therefore be pointless to allow the submission of applications for authorisation; in such cases the substance should be removed from the list of substances for which applications can be submitted.

(57) In order to provide a harmonised approach to the authorisation of the uses of particular substances, the Agency should issue opinions on the risks arising from those uses and on any socio-economic analysis submitted to it by third parties.

(58) To allow effective monitoring and enforcement of the authorisation requirement, downstream users benefiting from an authorisation granted to their supplier should inform the Agency of their use of the substance.

(59) In order to accelerate the current system the restriction procedure should be restructured and should replace Directive 76/769/EEC, which has been substantially amended and adapted several times. The acquis of the harmonised rules under the Annex to that Directive should be taken over in a recast version in the interests of clarity and as a starting point for this new accelerated restriction procedure. This recast follows the rules set out within the Interinstitutional Agreement concerning recasting techniques.

(60) It is the responsibility of the manufacturer, importer and the downstream user to identify the appropriate risk management measures needed to ensure a high level of protection for human health and the environment from the manufacturing, placing on the market or use of a substance on its own, in a preparation or in an article. However, where this is considered to be insufficient and where Community legislation is justified, appropriate restrictions should be laid down.

(61) In order to protect human health and the environment, restrictions on the manufacture, placing on the market or use of a substance on its own, in a preparation or in an article may include any condition for, or prohibition of, the manufacture, placing on the market or use. Therefore it is necessary to list such restrictions and any amendments thereto.

(62) In order to prepare a restrictions proposal and in order for such legislation to operate effectively, there should be good co-operation, co-ordination and information between the Member States, the Agency, other bodies of the Community, the Commission and the interested parties.

(63) In order to give Member States the opportunity to submit proposals to address a specific risk for human health and the environment, they should prepare a dossier in conformity with detailed requirements. The dossier should set out the justification for Community-wide action.

(64) In order to provide a harmonised approach to restrictions, the Agency should fulfil a role as co-ordinator of this procedure, for example by appointing the relevant rapporteurs and verifying conformity with the requirements of the relevant Annexes.

(65) In order to give the Commission the opportunity to address a specific risk for human health and the environment that needs to be addressed Community wide, it should be able to entrust the Agency with the preparation of a restriction dossier.

(66) For reasons of transparency, the Agency should publish the relevant dossier including the suggested restrictions while requesting comments.

(67) In order to finalise the procedure in due time, the Agency should submit its opinions on the suggested action and its impact on the basis of a draft opinion prepared by a rapporteur.

(68) In order to speed up the procedure for restrictions, the Commission should prepare its draft amendment within three months of receiving the Agency's opinions.

(69) The Agency should be central to ensuring that the chemicals law and the decision-making processes and scientific basis underlying it have credibility with all stakeholders and the public. The confidence in the Agency of the Community institutions, the Member States, the general public and interested parties is therefore essential. For this reason, it is vital to ensure its independence, high scientific, technical and regulatory capacities, transparency and efficiency.

(70) The structure of the Agency should be suitable for the tasks that it should fulfil. Experience with similar Community agencies provides some guidance in this respect but the structure should be adapted to meet the specific needs of this Regulation.

(71) In the interests of efficiency, the staff of the Agency Secretariat should perform essentially technical-administrative and scientific tasks without calling on the scientific and technical resources of the Member States; the Executive Director should ensure the efficient execution of the Agency's tasks in an independent manner. To ensure that the Agency fulfils its role, the composition of the Management Board should be designed to secure the highest standard of competence and a broad range of relevant expertise in chemicals safety or the regulation of chemicals.

(72) The Agency should have the means to perform all the tasks required to enable it to carry out its role.

(73) The Management Board should have the necessary powers to establish the budget, check its implementation, set the structure and amount of the fees, draw up internal rules, adopt financial regulations and appoint the Executive Director.

(74) It is appropriate for the Management Board of the Agency to include representatives from other interested parties, such as industry, non-governmental organisations and academia, in order to ensure the involvement of stakeholders.

(75) Through the Committee for Risk Assessment and the Committee for Socio-economic Analysis, the Agency should take over the role of the Scientific Committees attached to the Commission in issuing scientific opinions in its field of competence.

(76) Through the Member States Committee, the Agency should aim to reach agreement amongst Member States authorities on specific issues which require a harmonised approach.

(77) It is necessary to ensure close co-operation between the Agency and the competent authorities working within the Member States so that the scientific opinions of the Committee for Risk Assessment and the Committee for Socio-economic Analysis are based on the broadest possible scientific and technical expertise appropriate which is available within the Community; to the same end, the Committees should be able to rely on additional particular expertise.

(78) The Agency should also provide a Forum for Member States to exchange information on and to co-ordinate their activities related to the enforcement of chemicals legislation. The currently informal co-operation between Member States in this respect would benefit from a more formal framework.

(79) A Board of Appeal should be set up within the Agency to guarantee legal rights of appeal for the operators affected by decisions taken by the Agency.

(80) The Agency should be financed partly by fees paid by enterprises and partly by the general budget of the European Communities. The Community budgetary procedure should remain applicable as far as any subsidies chargeable to the general budget of the European Communities are concerned. Moreover, the auditing of accounts should be undertaken by the Court of Auditors in accordance with Article 91 of Commission Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2343/2002 of 23 December 2002 on the framework Financial Regulation for the bodies referred to in Article 185 of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities [16].

[16] OJ L 357, 31.12.2002, p. 72.

(81) Where the Commission and Agency consider it appropriate, it should be possible for other countries to participate in the work of the Agency.

(82) The Agency should contribute, through co-operation with organisations having interests in the harmonisation of international regulations, to the role of the Community and the Member States in such harmonisation activities.

(83) The Agency should provide the infrastructure needed for enterprises to meet their obligations under the data-sharing provisions.

(84) It is important to avoid confusion between the mission of the Agency and the respective missions of the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (Emea) established by Council Regulation (EC) No 2309/93 of 22 July 1993 laying down Community procedures for the authorization and supervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use and establishing a European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products [17] [insert new title plus footnote when proposal - COM(2001) 0404, COD 2001/0252 - is enacted], the European Food Safety Authority (Efsa) established by Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety [18] and the Advisory Committee on Safety, Hygiene and Health Protection at Work set up by Council Decision 2003/913/EC [19]. Consequently, the Agency should establish rules of procedure where co-operation with the Efsa or the Advisory Committee on Safety, Hygiene and Health Protection at Work is necessary. It is necessary to establish that this Regulation is otherwise without prejudice to the competence conferred on the Emea, the Efsa and the Advisory Committee on Safety, Hygiene and Health Protection at Work by Community legislation.

[17] OJ L 214, 24.8.1993, p. 1. Regulation as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1647/2003 (OJ L 245, 29.9.2003, p. 19).

[18] OJ L 31, 1.2.2002 p. 1. Regulation as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1642/2003 (OJ L 245,29.9.2003, p. 4).

[19] OJ C 218, 13.9.2003, p. 1.

(85) The feasibility study on the resource requirements for a central entity concluded that the most significant challenge to the effective functioning of the Agency was likely to be its ability to attract the right staff, including those working in the European Chemicals Bureau of the Commission's Joint Research Centre; the location should therefore enable the Agency to obtain the right staff in the start-up period as well as in the longer term.

(86) In order to achieve the functioning of the internal market for substances on their own or in preparations, while at the time ensuring a high level of protection for human health and the environment, rules should be established for a classification and labelling inventory.

(87) The classification and labelling for any substance either subject to registration or covered by Article 1 of Directive 67/548/EEC and placed on the market should therefore be notified to the Agency.

(88) To ensure a harmonised protection for the general public, and, in particular, for persons who come into contact with certain substances, an inventory should record the classification in accordance with Directive 67/548/EEC and Directive 1999/45/EC agreed by manufacturers and importers of the same substance, if possible, as well as decisions taken at Community level to harmonise the classification and labelling of some substances.

(89) Resources should be focused on substances of the highest concern. A substance should therefore be added to Annex I of Directive 67/548/EEC only if it meets the criteria for classification as carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic for reproduction categories 1, 2 or 3, or as a respiratory sensitiser. Provision should be made to enable competent authorities to submit proposals to the Agency. The Agency should give its opinion on the proposal while parties concerned should have an opportunity to comment. The Commission should take a decision subsequently.

(90) Regular reports by the Member States and the Agency on the operation of this Regulation will be an indispensable means of monitoring the implementation of chemicals legislation as well as trends in this field; conclusions drawn from findings in the reports will be useful and practical tools for reviewing the Regulation and, where necessary, for formulating proposals for amendments.

(91) Community citizens should have access to information about chemicals to which they may be exposed, in order to allow them to make informed decisions about their use of chemicals. A transparent means of achieving this is to grant them free and easy access to basic non-confidential data held in the Agency's database, including brief profiles of hazardous properties, labelling requirements and relevant Community legislation including authorised uses and risk management measures.

(92) Apart from their participation in the implementation of Community legislation, Member State competent authorities should, because of their closeness to stakeholders in the Member States, play a role in the exchange of information on risks of substances and on the obligations of enterprises under chemicals legislation; at the same time, close co-operation between the Agency, the Commission and the competent authorities of the Member States is necessary to ensure the coherence and efficiency of the global communication process.

(93) In order for the system established by this Regulation to operate effectively, there must be good co-operation and co-ordination between the Member States, the Agency and the Commission regarding enforcement.

(94) In order to ensure compliance with this Regulation, Member States should put in place effective monitoring and control measures.

(95) In order to ensure transparency, impartiality and consistency in the level of enforcement activities by Member States, it is necessary to set up an appropriate framework for sanctions with a view to imposing effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions for non-compliance, as non-compliance can result in damage to human health and the environment.

(96) The necessary inspections should be planned, carried out and their results should be reported.

(97) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation and certain amendments to it should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission [20].

[20] OJ L 184, 17.7.1999, p. 23.

(98) It is essential that chemicals be regulated in an effective and timely manner during the transition to full applicability of the provisions of this Regulation and, in particular, during the start-up period of the Agency; provision should therefore be made for the Commission to fulfil the functions of the Agency at least in the start-up period; if necessary, the Commission should be able to appoint an Executive Director ad interim until the Agency's Management Board can appoint an Executive Director itself.

(99) To take full advantage of the work performed under Regulation (EEC) No 793/93 as well as under Directive 76/769/EEC and to avoid such work going to waste, the Commission should be empowered during the start-up period to initiate restrictions based on that work without following the full restrictions procedure laid down in this Regulation.

(100) It is appropriate for the provisions of this Regulation to enter into force in a staggered way to smoothe the transition to the new system; moreover, a gradual entry into force of the provisions should allow all parties involved, authorities, enterprises as well as stakeholders, to focus resources in the preparation for new duties at the right times.

(101) This Regulation replaces Directive 76/769/EEC, Council Directive 91/157/EEC of 18 March 1991 on batteries and accumulators containing certain dangerous substances [21], Commission Directive 93/67/EEC of 20 July 1993 laying down the principles for assessment of risks to man and the environment of substances notified in accordance with Council Directive 67/548/EEC [22], Commission Directive 93/105/EEC of 25 November 1993 laying down Annex VII D, containing information required for the technical dossier referred to in Article 12 of the seventh amendment of Council Directive 67/548/EEC [23], Commission Directive 2000/21/EC of 25 April 2000 concerning the list of Community legislation referred to in the fifth indent of Article 13(1) of Council Directive 67/548/EEC [24], Regulation (EEC) No 793/93 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1488/94 of 28 June 1994 laying down the principles for the assessment of risks to man and the environment of existing substances in accordance with Council Regulation (EEC) No 793/93 [25].

(103) In accordance with the principle of proportionality, it is necessary and appropriate for the achievement of the basic objective of this Regulation to lay down rules for chemical substances and to establish a European Chemicals Agency. This Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve the objectives pursued, in accordance with the third paragraph of Article 5 of the Treaty.

(104) The Regulation observes the fundamental rights and principles which are acknowledged in particular in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union [27]. In particular, it seeks to ensure full compliance with the principles of environmental protection and sustainable development guaranteed by its Article 37,

Chapter 2 Definitions

Article 3 Definitions

For the purposes of this Regulation:

1. Substance means a chemical element and its compounds in the natural state or obtained by any manufacturing process, including any additive necessary to preserve its stability and any impurity deriving from the process used, but excluding any solvent which may be separated without affecting the stability of the substance or changing its composition;

2. Preparation means a mixture or solution composed of two or more substances;

3. Article means an object composed of one or more substances or preparations which during production is given a specific shape, surface or design determining its end use function to a greater degree than its chemical composition does;

4. Polymer means a substance consisting of molecules characterised by the sequence of one or more types of monomer units. Such molecules must be distributed over a range of molecular weights wherein differences in the molecular weight are primarily attributable to differences in the number of monomer units. A polymer comprises the following:

(a) a simple weight majority of molecules containing at least three monomer units which are covalently bound to at least one other monomer unit or other reactant;

(b) less than a simple weight majority of molecules of the same molecular weight.

In the context of this definition a 'monomer unit' means the reacted form of a monomer substance in a polymer;

5. Registrant means the manufacturer or the importer submitting a registration;

6. Manufacturing means production and extraction of substances in the natural state;

7. Manufacturer means any natural or legal person established within the Community who manufactures a substance within the Community;

8. Import means the physical introduction into the customs territory of the Community;

9. Importer means any natural or legal person established within the Community who is responsible for import;

10. Placing on the market means supplying or making available, whether in return for payment or free of charge, to a third party. Import into the customs territory of the Community shall be deemed to be placing on the market;

11. Downstream user means any natural or legal person established within the Community, other than the manufacturer or the importer, who uses a substance, either on its own or in a preparation, in the course of his industrial or professional activities. A distributor or a consumer is not a downstream user. A re-importer exempted pursuant to Article 4(2)(c) shall be regarded as a downstream user;

12. Use means any processing, formulation, consumption, storage, keeping, treatment, filling into containers, transfer from one container to another, mixing, production of an article or any other utilisation;

13. Distributor means any natural or legal person established within the Community, including a retailer, who only stores and places on the market a substance, on its own or in a preparation, for third parties;

14. Intermediate means a substance that is solely manufactured for and consumed in or used for chemical processing in order to be transformed into another substance (hereinafter called synthesis):

(a) non-isolated intermediate means an intermediate that during synthesis is not intentionally removed (except for sampling) from the equipment in which the synthesis takes place. Such equipment includes the reaction vessel, its ancillary equipment, and any equipment through which the substance(s) pass(es) during a continuous flow or batch process as well as the pipework for transfer from one vessel to another for the purpose of the next reaction step, but it excludes tanks or other vessels in which the substance(s) are stored after the manufacture;

(b) on-site isolated intermediate means an intermediate not meeting the criteria of a non-isolated intermediate and where the manufacture of the intermediate and the synthesis of (an)other substance(s) from that intermediate take place on the same site, operated by one more legal entities;

(c) transported isolated intermediate means an intermediate not meeting the criteria of a non-isolated intermediate and transported between or supplied to other sites;

15. Site means a single location, in which, if there is more than one manufacturer of (a) substance(s), certain infrastructure and facilities are shared;

16. Actors in the supply chain means all manufacturers and/or importers and/or downstream users;

17. Communicate down the supply chain means that each actor in the supply chain communicates to the downstream user whom he supplies with a substance;

ANNEX I General provisions for Assessing Substances and Preparing Chemical Safety Reports

0. Introduction

0.1. The purpose of this Annex is to set out how manufacturers and importers are to assess and document that the risks arising from the substance they manufacture or import are adequately controlled during manufacture and their own use(s) and that others further down the supply chain can adequately control the risks.

0.2. The chemical safety assessment shall address all the identified uses. It shall consider the use of the substance on its own (including any major impurities and additives), in a preparation or in an article. The assessment shall consider all stages of the life-cycle of the substance as defined by the identified uses. The chemical safety assessment shall be based on a comparison of the potential adverse effects of a substance with the known or reasonably foreseeable exposure of man and/or the environment to that substance.

0.3. If the manufacturer or importer considers that the chemical safety assessment carried out for one substance is sufficient to assess and document that the risks arising from another substance or from a group of substances are adequately controlled then he can use that chemical safety assessment for the other substance or group of substances. The manufacturer or importer shall provide a justification for this.

0.4. The chemical safety assessment shall be based on the information on the substance contained in the technical dossier and on other available and relevant information. Available information from assessments carried out under other international and national programmes shall be included. Where available and appropriate, an assessment carried out under Community legislation (e.g. risk assessments completed under Regulation 793/93) shall be taken into account in the development of, and reflected in, the chemical safety report. Deviations from such assessments shall be justified.

Thus the information to be considered includes information related to the hazard of the substance, the exposure arising from the manufacture or import and the identified uses of the substance.

In accordance with Annex IX, Section 3, in some cases, it may not be necessary to generate missing information, because risk management measures which are necessary to control a well-characterised risk may also be sufficient to control other potential risks, which will not therefore need to be characterised precisely.

If the manufacturer or importer considers that further information is necessary for producing his chemical safety report and that this information can only be obtained by performing tests in accordance with Annex VII or VIII using vertebrate animals, he shall submit a proposal for a testing strategy, explaining why he considers that additional information is necessary and record this in the chemical safety report under the appropriate heading. While waiting for results of further testing, he shall record the risk management measures he has put in place in his chemical safety report.

0.5. A chemical safety assessment performed by a manufacturer or an importer for a substance shall include the following steps in accordance with the respective sections of this Annex:

1. Human health hazard assessment

2. Human health hazard assessment of physicochemical properties

3. Environmental hazard assessment

4. PBT and vPvB assessment

If as a result of steps 1 to 4 the manufacturer or importer concludes that the substance or the preparation meets the criteria for classification as dangerous according to Directive 67/548/EEC or Directive 1999/45/EC or is assessed to be a PBT or vPvB, the chemical safety assessment shall also consider the following steps:

5. Exposure assessment

6. Risk characterisation

A summary of all the relevant information used in addressing the points above, shall be presented under the relevant heading of the chemical safety report (Section 7).

0.6. The main element of the exposure part of the chemical safety report is the description of the manufacturer's or importer's exposure scenario(s) and the exposure scenario(s) recommended by the manufacturer or importer to be implemented for the identified use(s). The exposure scenarios contain a description of the risk management measures which the manufacturer or importer has implemented and recommends to be implemented by downstream users. If the substance is placed on the market, these exposure scenarios including the risk management measures shall be summarised in an annex to the safety data sheet in accordance with Annex IA.

0.7. The level of detail required in describing an exposure scenario will vary substantially from case to case, depending on the use of a substance, its hazardous properties and the amount of information available to the manufacturer or importer. Exposure scenarios can describe the appropriate risk management measures for several individual uses of a substance. Single exposure scenarios may thereby cover large ranges of uses.

0.8. The process which the manufacturer or importer goes through, in carrying out their chemical safety assessment and developing their chemical safety reports, may be iterative. Iterations may consider on the one hand developing and revising the exposure scenario(s), which may include developing and implementing or recommending risk management measures, and on the other hand the need to generate further information. The purpose of generating further information is to establish a more precise risk characterisation, based on a refined hazard assessment or exposure assessment. This will allow appropriate information to be communicated down the supply chain in the safety data sheet.

0.9. Where information is not necessary in accordance with Annex IX , this fact shall be stated under the appropriate heading of the chemical safety report and a reference shall be made to the justification in the technical dossier. This fact that no information is required shall also be stated in the safety data sheet.

0.10. In relation to particular effects, such as ozone depletion, for which the procedures set out in Sections 1 to 6 are impracticable, the risks associated with such effects shall be assessed on a case-by-case basis and the manufacturer or importer shall include a full description and justification of such assessments in the chemical safety report and summarised in the safety data sheet.

0.11. Where the methodology described in this Annex is not appropriate, details of alternative methodology used shall be explained and justified in the chemical safety report.

0.12. Part A of the chemical safety report shall include a declaration that the risk management measures outlined in the relevant exposure scenarios for the manufacturer's or importer's own use(s) are implemented by the manufacturer or importer and that those exposure scenarios for the identified uses are communicated to all known users further down the supply chain in the safety data sheet.

1. Human Health Hazard Assessment

1.0. Introduction

1.0.1. The objective of the human health hazard assessment shall be:

- to determine the classification and labelling of a substance in accordance with Directive 67/548; and

- to derive levels of exposure to the substance above which humans should not be exposed. This level of exposure is known as the Derived No-Effect Level (Dnel).

1.0.2. The human health hazard assessment shall consider the following groups of potential effects: (1) toxicokinetics, metabolism and distribution, (2) acute effects (acute toxicity, irritation and corrosivity), (3) sensitisation, (4) repeated dose toxicity and (5) CMR effects (carcinogenity, mutagenicity and toxicity for reproduction). Based on all the available information, other effects shall be considered when necessary.

1.0.3. The hazard assessment shall comprise the following four steps:

Step 1. Evaluation of non-human data

Step 2. Evaluation of human data

Step 3. Classification and Labelling

Step 4. Derivation of Derived No-Effect Levels (Dnels)

1.0.4. The first three steps shall be undertaken for every effect for which information is available and shall be recorded under the relevant section of the Chemical Safety Report and where required and in accordance with Article 29, summarised in the Safety Data Sheet under headings 2 and 11.

1.0.5. For any effect for which no relevant information is available, the relevant section shall contain the sentence "This information is not required by this regulation. See the justification at ...".

1.0.6. Step 4 of the human health hazard assessment shall be undertaken by integrating the results from the first three steps and shall be included under the relevant heading of the Chemical Safety Report and summarised in the Safety Data Sheet under heading 8.1.

1.1. Step 1: Evaluation of non-human data

1.1.1. The evaluation of non-human data shall comprise:

- the hazard identification for the effect based on all available non-human data;

- the establishment of the quantitative dose (concentration) - response (effect) relationship.

1.1.2. When it is not possible to establish the quantitative dose (concentration) - response (effect) relationship, then this should be justified and a semi-quantitative or qualitative analysis shall be included. For acute effects it is usually not possible to establish the quantitative dose (concentration) - response (effect) relationship on the basis of the results of a test conducted in accordance with Annex X. In such cases it suffices to determine whether and to which degree the substance has an inherent capacity to cause the effect.

1.1.3. All non-human data used to assess a particular effect on humans and to establish the dose (concentration) - response (effect) relationship, shall be briefly presented, if possible in the form of a table or tables, distinguishing between in vitro, in vivo and other data. The relevant test results (e.g., LD50, NO(A)EL or LO(A)EL) and test conditions (e.g., test duration, route of administration) and other relevant information shall be presented, in internationally recognised units of measurement for that effect.

1.1.4 If there are several studies addressing the same effect, then normally the study or studies giving rise to the highest concern shall be used to establish the Derived No-Effect Levels and a robust study summary shall be prepared for that study or studies and included as part of the technical dossier. If the study or studies giving rise to the highest concern are not used, then this shall be fully justified and robust study summaries shall be prepared and included as part of the technical dossier, not only for the study being used but also for all studies demonstrating a higher concern than the study being used. For substances where all available studies indicate no hazards an overall assessment of the validity of all studies should be performed.

1.2. Step 2: Evaluation of human data

If no human data are available, this part shall contain the statement "No human data are available". However, if human data is available, it shall be presented, if possible in the form of a table.

1.3. Step 3: Classification and Labelling

1.3.1. The appropriate classification and labelling developed in accordance with the criteria in Directive 67/548 shall be presented and justified. A comparison of the available data with the criteria given in Directive 67/548 for CMR, categories 1 and 2, shall always be performed and a statement presented of whether the substance fulfils or does not fulfil those criteria.

1.3.2. If the data are inadequate to decide whether a substance should be classified for a particular end-point, the registrant shall indicate and justify the action or decision he has taken as a result.

1.4. Step 4: Identification of Derived No-Effect Level(s) (DNEL(s))

1.4.1. Based on the outcomes of steps 1 to 3, a Derived No-Effect Level(s) shall be established for the substance, reflecting the likely route(s), duration and frequency of exposure. If justified by the exposure scenario(s), a single Dnel may be sufficient. However, taking into account the available data and the exposure scenario(s) in Section 5 of the Chemical Safety Report it may be necessary to identify different DNELs for each relevant human population (e.g., workers, consumers and humans liable to exposure indirectly via the environment) and possibly for certain sub-populations (e.g. children, pregnant women) and for different routes of exposure. A full justification shall be given specifying, inter alia, the choice of the data used, the route of exposure (oral, dermal, inhalation) and the duration and frequency of exposure to the substance for which the Dnel is valid. If more than one route of exposure is likely to occur, then a Dnel shall be estgablished for each route of exposure and for the exposure from all routes combined. When established the Dnel, the following factors shall, inter alia, be taken into account:

(i) the uncertainty arising, among other factors, from the variability in the experimental data and from intra- and inter-species variation;

(ii) the nature and severity of the effect;

(iii) the human population to which the quantitative and/or qualitative information on exposure applies.

1.4.2. If it is not possible to identify a Dnel, then this shall be clearly stated and fully justified.

2. Physicochemical Hazard assessment

2.1. The objective of the hazard assessment for physicochemical properties shall be to determine the classification and labelling of a substance in accordance with Directive 67/548.

2.2. The potential effects to human health shall be assessed for at least the following physicochemical properties:

- explosivity,

- flammability,

- oxidizing potential.

If the data are inadequate to decide whether a substance should be classified for a particular end-point, the registrant shall indicate and justify the action or decision he has taken as a result.

2.3. The assessment of each effect shall be presented under the relevant heading of the Chemical Safety Report (Section 7) and where required and in accordance with Article 29, summarised in the Safety Data Sheet under headings 2 and 9.

2.4. For every physicochemical property, the assessment shall entail an evaluation of the inherent capacity of the substance to cause the effect.

2.5. The appropriate classification and labelling developed in accordance with the criteria in Directive 67/548 shall be presented and justified.

3. Environmental Hazard Assessment

3.0. Introduction

3.0.1. The objective of the environmental hazard assessment shall be to determine the classification and labelling of a substance in accordance with Directive 67/548 and to identify the concentration of the substance below which adverse effects in the environmental sphere of concern are not expected to occur. This concentration is known as the Predicted No-Effect Concentration (Pnec).

3.0.2. The environmental hazard assessment shall consider the potential effects on the environment, comprising the (1) aquatic (including sediment), (2) terrestrial and (3) atmospheric compartments, including the potential effects that may occur (4) via food-chain accumulation. In addition, the potential effects on the (5) microbiological activity of sewage treatment systems shall be considered. The assessment of the effects on each of these five environmental spheres shall be presented under the relevant heading of the Chemical Safety Report (Section 7) and where required and in accordance with Article 29, summarised in the Safety Data Sheet under headings 2 and 12.

3.0.3. For any environmental sphere, for which no effect information is available, the relevant section shall contain the sentence "This information is not required by this regulation. See the justification at ...". For any environmental sphere for which information is available, but the manufacturer or importer believes that it is not necessary to conduct the hazard assessment, the manufacturer or importer shall present a justification under the relevant heading of the Chemical Safety Report (Section 7) and where required and in accordance with Article 29, summarised in the Safety Data Sheet under heading 12.

3.0.4. The hazard assessment shall comprise the following three steps, which shall be clearly identified as such in the Chemical Safety Report:

Step 1. Evaluation of data

Step 2. Classification and Labelling

Step 3. Derivation of the Predicted No-Effect Concentration (Pnec)

3.1. Step 1: Evaluation of data

3.1.1. The evaluation of all available data shall comprise:

- the hazard identification based on all available data;

- the establishment of the quantitative dose (concentration) - response (effect) relationship.

3.1.2. When it is not possible to establish the quantitative dose (concentration) - response (effect) relationship, then this should be justified and a semi-quantitative or qualitative analysis shall be included.

3.1.3. All data used to assess the effects on a specific environmental sphere shall be briefly presented, if possible in the form of a table or tables. The relevant test results (e.g. LC50 or NOEC) and test conditions (e.g. test duration, route of administration) and other relevant information shall be presented, in internationally recognised units of measurement for that effect.

3.1.4. All data used to assess the environmental fate of the substance shall be briefly presented, if possible in the form of a table or tables. The relevant test results and test conditions and other relevant information shall be presented, in internationally recognised units of measurement for that effect.

3.1.5. If there are several studies addressing the same effect, then the study or studies giving rise to the highest concern shall be used to draw a conclusion and a robust study summary shall be prepared for that study or studies and included as part of the technical dossier. If the study or studies giving rise to the highest concern are not used, then this shall be fully justified and robust study summaries shall be prepared and included as part of the technical dossier, not only for the study being used but also for all studies reaching a higher concern than the study being used. For substances where all available studies indicate no hazards an overall assessment of the validity of all studies should be performed.

3.2. Step 2: Classification and Labelling

3.2.1. The appropriate classification and labelling developed in accordance with the criteria in Directive 67/548 shall be presented and justified.

3.2.2. If the data are inadequate to decide whether a substance should be classified for a particular end-point, the registrant shall indicate and justify the action or decision he has taken as a result.

3.3. Step 3: Identification of the Predicted No-Effect Concentration

3.3.1. Based on the available data, the Pnec for each environmental sphere shall be established. The Pnec may be calculated by applying an appropriate assessment factor to the effect values (e.g. LC50 or NOEC) derived from tests on organisms. An assessment factor expresses the difference between effects values derived for a limited number of species from laboratory tests and the Pnec for the environmental sphere [63].

[63] In general, the more extensive the data and the longer the duration of the tests, the smaller is the degree of uncertainty and the size of the assessment factor. An assessment factor of 1000 is typically applied to the lowest of three short term L(E)C50 values derived from species representing different trophic levels and a factor of 10 to the lowest of three long-term NOEC values derived from species representing different trophic levels.

3.3.2. If it is not possible to derive the Pnec, then this shall be clearly stated and fully justified.

4. PBT and vPvB assessment

4.0. Introduction

4.0.1. The objective of the PBT and vPvB assessment shall be to determine if the substance fulfils the criteria given in Annex XII and if so, to characterise the potential emissions of the substance. A hazard assessment in accordance with Sections 1 and 3 of this Annex addressing all the long-term effects and the estimation of the long-term exposure of humans and the environment as carried out in accordance with Section 5 (Exposure Assessment), step 2 (Exposure Estimation), cannot be carried out with sufficient reliability for substances satisfying the PBT and vPvB criteria, which necessitates the need for a separate PBT and vPvB assessment.

4.0.2. The PBT and vPvB assessment shall be based on all the information submitted as part of the technical dossier. If the technical dossier contains for one or more endpoints only information as required in Annexes V and VI, the registrant shall consider whether further information needs to be generated to fulfil the objective of the PBT and vPvB assessment.

4.0.3. The PBT and vPvB assessment shall comprise the following two steps, which shall be clearly identified as such in Part C, Section 7 of the Chemical Safety Report:

Step 1. Comparison with the Criteria

Step 2. Emission Characterisation

The assessment shall also be summarised in the Safety Data Sheet under heading 12.

4.1. Step 1: Comparison with the Criteria

This part of the PBT and vPvB assessment shall entail the comparison of the available data with the criteria given in Annex XII and a statement of whether the substance fulfils or does not fulfil the criteria. If the available data are not sufficient to decide whether the substance fulfils the criteria in Annex XII, then other evidence giving rise to an equivalent level of concern shall be considered on a case-by-case basis.

4.2. Step 2: Emission Characterisation

If the substance fulfils the criteria an emission characterisation shall be conducted comprising the relevant parts of the exposure assessment as described in Section 5. In particular it shall contain an estimation of the amounts of the substance released to the different environmental compartments during all activities carried out by the manufacturer or importer and all identified uses, and an identification of the likely routes by which humans and the environment are exposed to the substance.

5. Exposure assessment

5.0. Introduction

The objective of the exposure assessment shall be to make a quantitative or qualitative estimate of the dose/concentration of the substance to which humans and the environment are or may be exposed. The exposure assessment shall entail the following two steps, which shall be clearly identified as such in the chemical safety report:

Step 1. Development of exposure scenarios

Step 2. Exposure Estimation

Where required and in accordance with Article 29, the assessment shall also be summarised in an annex to the safety data sheet.

5.1. Step 1: Development of exposure scenarios

5.1.1. Exposure scenarios shall be developed for manufacture in the Community, manufacturer's and importer's own use, and all identified uses. An exposure scenario is the set of conditions that describe how the substance is manufactured or used during its life-cycle and how the manufacturer or importer controls, or recommends downstream users to control, exposures of humans and the environment. These exposure scenarios may be as wide-ranging or specific as necessary. The exposure scenario shall be presented under the relevant heading of the chemical safety report, and summarised in an annex to the safety data sheet, using an appropriate short title giving a brief general description of the use . In particular, an exposure scenario includes, where relevant, a description of:

- the processes involved in the production by the manufacturer and, if relevant, the further processing and use by the manufacturer or importer, including the physical form in which the substance is manufactured, processed and/or used;

- the processes involved in the identified use of the substance foreseen by the manufacturer or importer, including the physical form in which the substance is processed and/or used;

- the risk management measures implemented by the manufacturer or importer to reduce or avoid exposure of humans (including workers and consumers) and the environment to the substance;

- the risk management measures which the manufacturer or importer recommends to be implemented by the downstream users to reduce or avoid exposure of humans (including workers and consumers) and the environment to the substance;

- the waste management measures implemented by the manufacturer or importer and those recommended to be implemented by the downstream user or consumer to reduce or avoid exposure of humans and the environment to the substance during waste, disposal and/or recycling;

- the activities of workers related to the processes and the duration and frequency of their exposure to the substance;

- the activities of consumers and the duration and frequency of their exposure to the substance;

- the duration and frequency of emissions of the substance to the different environmental compartments and sewage treatment systems and the dilution in the receiving environmental compartment.

5.1.2. When the assessment is identified to be used for an application for an authorisation for a specific use, exposure scenarios need only be developed for those uses and the subsequent life-cycle steps.

5.2. Step 2: Exposure Estimation

5.2.1. The exposure shall be estimated for each exposure scenario developed and shall be presented under the relevant heading of the chemical safety report and where required and in accordance with Article 29, summarised in an annex to the safety data sheet. The exposure estimation entails three elements: (1) emission estimation; (2) chemical fate and pathways; and (3) estimation of exposure levels.

5.2.2. The emission estimation shall consider the emissions during all relevant parts of the life-cycle of the substance under the assumption that the risk management measures described in the exposure scenario have been implemented.

5.2.3. A characterisation of possible degradation, transformation, or reaction processes and an estimation of environmental distribution and fate shall be performed.

5.2.4 An estimation of the exposure levels shall be performed for all human populations (workers, consumers and humans liable to exposure indirectly via the environment) and environmental spheres for which exposure to the substance is known or reasonably foreseeable. Each relevant route of human exposure (inhalation, oral, dermal and combined through all relevant routes of exposure) shall be addressed. Such estimations shall take account of spatial and temporal variations in the exposure pattern. In particular, the exposure estimation shall take account of:

- adequately measured, representative exposure data,

- any major impurities and additives in the substance,

- the quantity in which the substance is produced and/or imported,

- the quantity for each identified use,

- the degree of containment,

- the physicochemical properties of the substance,

- transformation and/or degradation products,

- the likely routes of exposure of and potential for absorption in humans,

- the likely pathways to the environment and environmental distribution and degradation and/or transformation (see also Section 3 Step 1).

5.2.5 Where adequately measured representative exposure data are available, special consideration shall be given to them when conducting the exposure assessment. Appropriate models can be used for the estimation of exposure levels. Relevant monitoring data from substances with analogous use and exposure patterns or analogous properties can also be considered.

6. Risk Characterisation

6.1 The risk characterisation shall be carried out for each exposure scenario and shall be presented under the relevant heading of the Chemical Safety Report.

6.2 The risk characterisation shall consider the human populations (exposed as workers, consumers or indirectly via the environment and if relevant a combination thereof) and the environmental spheres for which exposure to the substance is known or reasonably foreseeable, under the assumption that the risk management measures described in the exposure scenarios in the previous Section have been implemented. In addition, the overall environmental risk caused by the substance shall be reviewed by integrating the results for all relevant spheres and all relevant emission/release sources of the substance.

6.3 The risk characterisation consists of:

- a comparison of the exposure of each human population known to be or likely to be exposed with the appropriate Derived No-Effect Levels;

- a comparison of the predicted environmental concentrations in each environmental sphere with the Pnecs; and

- an assessment of the likelihood and severity of an event occurring due to the physicochemical properties of the substance.

6.4 For any exposure scenario, the exposures of humans and the environment can be considered to be adequately controlled, if:

- the exposure levels estimated in Section 6.2 do not exceed the appropriate Dnel or the Pnec, as determined in Sections 1 and 3, respectively, and;

- the likelihood and severity of an event occurring due to the physicochemical properties of the substance as determined in Section 2 is negligible.

6.5 For those human effects and those environmental spheres for which it was not possible to determine a Dnel or a Pnec, a qualitative assessment of the likelihood that effects are avoided when implementing the exposure scenario shall be carried out.

For substances satisfying the PBT and vPvB criteria, the manufacturer or importer shall use the information as obtained in Section 5, Step 2 when implementing on its site, and recommending for downstream users, risk management measures which minimise exposures to humans and the environment.

7. Chemical Safety Report Format

ANNEX Ia

GUIDE TO THE COMPILATION OF SAFETY DATA SHEETS

This Annex sets out the requirements for a Safety Data Sheet that is provided for a substance or a preparation in accordance with Article 29. The Safety Data Sheet provides a mechanism for transmitting appropriate information from the relevant Chemical Safety Report(s) down the supply chain to the immediate downstream user(s). The information provided in the Safety Data Sheet shall be consistent with the information in the chemical safety report, where one is required. Where a chemical safety report has been performed, the relevant exposure scenario(s) shall be placed into an annex of the safety data sheet, to make reference to them under the relevant headings of the safety data sheet easier.

The purpose of this Annex is to ensure consistency and accuracy in the content of each of the mandatory headings listed in Article 29, so that the resulting safety data sheets will enable users to take the necessary measures relating to protection of health and safety at the workplace, and protection of the environment.

The information provided by safety data sheets shall also meet the requirements set out in Council Directive 98/24/EC( [64]) on the protection of the health and safety of workers from the risks related to chemical agents at work. In particular, the safety data sheet shall enable the employer to determine whether any hazardous chemical agents are present in the workplace, and to assess any risk to the health and safety of workers arising from their use.

[64] OJ L131, 5.5.1998, p.11

The information in the Safety Data Sheet shall be written in a clear and concise manner. The safety data sheet shall be prepared by a competent person who shall take into account the specific needs of the user audience, as far as it is known. Persons placing substances and preparations on the market shall ensure that competent persons have received appropriate training, including refresher training.

For preparations not classified as dangerous, but for which a safety data sheet is required according to Article 30, proportionate information shall be provided under each heading.

Additional information may be necessary in some cases in view of the wide range of properties of the substances and preparations. If in other cases it emerges that information on certain properties is of no significance or that it is technically impossible to provide, the reasons for this shall be clearly stated under each heading. Information shall be provided for each hazardous property. If it is stated that a particular hazard does not apply, clearly differentiate between cases where no information is available to the classifier, and cases where negative test results are available.

Give the date of issue of the safety data sheet on the first page. When a safety data sheet has been revised, the changes shall be brought to the attention of the recipient.

Note

Safety data sheets are also required for certain special substances and preparations (e.g. metals in massive form, alloys, compressed gases etc.) listed in chapters 8 and 9 of Annex VI to Directive 67/548/EEC, for which there are labelling derogations.

1. identification of the substance/preparation and of the company/undertaking

ANNEX Ib chemical safety assessments for Preparations

A chemical safety assessment for a preparation shall be conducted in accordance with Annex I with the following modifications:

1. Information base

The chemical safety assessment for a preparation shall be based on the information on the individual substances in the preparation contained in the technical dossier and/or the information communicated by the supplier in the safety data sheet. It shall also be based on the information available on the preparation itself.

2. Hazard assessments

The hazard assessments (human health, human health for physicochemical properties and environmental) shall be carried out in accordance with Sections 1, 2 and 3 with the following alterations:

(a) For the evaluation of data step(s), any relevant data for the preparation, the classification for each substance in the preparation and any specific concentration limits for each substance in the preparation shall be presented.

(b) For the classification and labelling step, the classification and labelling for the preparation in accordance with European Parliament and Council Directive 1999/45/EC shall be presented and justified.

(c) For the derivation of derived no-effect levels (Dnels), the Dnel for each substance in the preparation with an appropriate reference to the safety data sheet of the supplier shall be listed, as well as the Dnel derived for the preparation, with a justification on their derivation. In lack of any information to the contrary, then additivity of effects shall be assumed. The Dnels for the preparation can then be calculated for each route of exposure and each exposure scenario as a weighted average of the Dnels for each substance in the preparation, with the weights being the fraction of the exposure to the substance in the preparation to the total exposure to all substances in the preparation.

(d) For the derivation of the predicted no-effect concentrations (Pnecs), the Pnec for each substance in the preparation with an appropriate reference to the safety data sheet of the supplier shall be listed, as well as the Pnecs derived for the preparation, with a justification on their derivation. In lack of any information to the contrary, then additivity of effects shall be assumed. The Pnecs for the preparation can then be calculated for each environmental sphere and each exposure scenario as a weighted average of the Pnecs for each substance in the preparation, with the weights being the fraction of the exposure to the substance in the preparation to the total exposure to all substances in the preparation.

3. pbt assessment

If the preparation contains a substance fulfilling the criteria given in Annex XII, then this shall be stated in the chemical safety report.

4. Exposure assessment

4.1 The objective of the exposure assessment shall be to make a quantitative or qualitative estimate of the dose/concentration of the preparation to which humans and the environment are or may be exposed.

4.2 Exposure scenarios shall be developed in accordance with Section 5.1 of Annex I. Exposure shall be estimated for each exposure scenario developed and for each substance in the preparation in accordance with Section 5.2 of Annex I.

4.3 Assuming additivity of effects, then for each route of human exposure and each human population and for each environmental sphere, the estimation of the exposure level to the preparation is the sum of the estimates of the exposure level to each substance in the preparation.

ANNEX IV information requirements referred to in article 9

Guidance note on fulfilling the requirements of annexes IV to IX

Annexes IV to IX specify the information that shall be submitted for registration and evaluation purposes according to Articles 9, 11 and 12, 39, 40 and 44. For the lowest tonnage level, the standard requirements are in Annex V, and every time a new tonnage level is reached, the requirements of the corresponding Annex have to be added. For each registration the precise information requirements will differ, according to tonnage, use and exposure. The Annexes shall thus be considered as a whole, and in conjunction with the overall requirements of registration, evaluation and the duty of care.

Step 1 - gather and share existing information

The registrant should gather all existing available test data on the substance to be registered. Wherever practicable, registrations should be submitted by consortia, in accordance with Article 10 or 17. This will enable test data to be shared, thereby avoiding unnecessary testing and reducing costs. The registrant should also collect all other available information on the substance. This should include alternative data (e.g. from (Q)SARs, read-across from other substances, in-vitro testing, epidemiological data) which may assist in identifying the presence or absence of hazardous properties of the substance and which can in certain cases replace the results of animal tests. In addition, information on exposure, use and risk management measures in accordance with Article 9 and Annex V should be collected. Considering all this information together, the registrant will be able to determine the need to generate further information.

step 2 - consider information needs

The registrant shall identify what information is required for the registration. First, the relevant Annex or Annexes to be followed shall be identified, according to tonnage. These Annexes set out the standard information requirements, but shall be considered in conjunction with Annex IX, which allows variation from the standard approach, where it can be justified. In particular, information on exposure, use and risk management measures shall be considered at this stage in order to determine the information needs for the substance.

step 3 - identify information gaps

The registrant shall then compare the information needs for the substance with the information already available and identify where there are gaps. It is important at this stage to ensure that the available data is relevant and sufficient to fulfil requirements.

step 4 - generate new data/propose testing strategy

In some cases it will not be necessary to generate new data. However, where there is an information gap that needs to be filled, new data shall be generated (Annexes V and VI), or a testing strategy shall be proposed (Annexes VII and VIII), depending on the tonnage. New tests on vertebrates shall only be conducted or proposed as a last resort when all other data sources have been exhausted.

In some cases, the rules set out in Annex V to IX may require certain tests to be undertaken earlier than or in addition to the standard requirements.

5.4. Relative density // 5.4. The study does not need to be conducted if:

- the substance is only stable in solution in a particular solvent and the solution density is similar to that of the solvent. In such cases, an indication of whether the solution density is higher or lower than the solvent density is sufficient; or

- the water solubility is below 1 mg/l at 20 °C or

- the substance forms micelles in the relevant concentration range for testing.

5.7. Water solubility // 5.7. The study does not need to be conducted if:

- the substance is hydrolytically unstable (half-life less than 12 hours); or

- the substance is readily oxidisable in water.

If the substance appears "insoluble" in water, a limit test up to the detection limit of the analytical method shall be performed.

//

5.8. Partition coefficient n-octanol/water // 5.9. The study does not need to be conducted if the substance is inorganic. If the test cannot be performed (e.g. the substance decomposes, has a high surface activity, reacts violently during the performance of the test or does not dissolve in water or in octanol, or it is not possible to obtain a sufficiently pure substance), a calculated value for log P as well as details of the calculation method shall be provided.

- the flash-point can be accurately predicted by interpolation from existing characterised materials.

5.10. Flammability // 5.11. The study does not need to be conducted:

- if the substance is a solid which possesses explosive or pyrophoric properties. These properties should always be considered before considering flammability; or

- for gases, if the concentration of the flammable gas in a mixture with inert gases is so low that, when mixed with air, the concentration is all time below the lower limit; or

- for substances which spontaneously ignite when in contact with air.

5.11. Explosive properties // 5.12. The study does not need to be conducted if:

- there are no chemical groups associated with explosive properties present in the molecule; or

- the substance contains chemical groups associated with explosive properties which include oxygen and the calculated oxygen balance is less than -200; or

- the organic substance or a homogenous mixture of organic substances contains chemical groups associated with explosive properties, but the exothermic decomposition energy is less than 500 J/g and the onset of exothermic decomposition is below 500 ºC; or

- for mixtures of inorganic oxidising substances (UN Division 5.1) with organic materials, the concentration of the inorganic oxidising substance is:

- less than 15%, by mass, if assigned to UN Packaging Group I (high hazard) or II (medium hazard)

- less than 30%, by mass, if assigned to UN Packaging Group III (low hazard).

Note: Neither a test for propagation of detonation nor a test for sensitivity to detonative shock is required if the exothermic decomposition energy of organic materials is less than 800 J/g.

5.12. Self-ignition temperature // 5.13. The study does not need to be conducted:

- if the substance is explosive or ignites spontaneously with air at room temperature; or

- for liquids non flammable in air, e.g. no flash point up to 200 °C; or

- the substance is incapable of reacting exothermically with combustible materials, for example on the basis of the chemical structure (e.g. organic substances not containing oxygen or halogen atoms and these elements are not chemically bonded to nitrogen or oxygen, or inorganic substances not containing oxygen or halogen atoms).

The full test does not need to be conducted for solids if the preliminary test clearly indicates that the test substance has oxidising properties.

Note that as there is no test method to determine the oxidising properties of gaseous mixtures, the evaluation of these properties must be realised by an estimation method based on the comparison of the oxidising potential of gases in a mixture with that of the oxidising potential of oxygen in air.

5.14. Granulometry // 5.15. The study does not need to be conducted if the substance is marketed or used in a non solid or granular form.

6.6. Repeated dose toxicity //

6.6.1. Short-term repeated dose toxicity study (28 days), one species, male and female, most appropriate route of administration, having regard to the likely route of human exposure. // 6.6.1. The short-term toxicity study (28 days) does not need to be conducted if:

- relevant human exposure can be excluded.

The appropriate route shall be chosen on the following basis:

Testing by the dermal route is appropriate if:

- the substance is a powder containing more than 1% particles on a w/w basis, with a particle size MMAD less than 100 ìm; or

the substance will be used in a manner which generates aerosols, particles or droplets in an inhalable size range (&gt; 1% on a w/w basis of particles with MMAD &lt; 100 ìm). In the absence of contra-indications, the oral route shall be the preferred one.

// The sub-chronic toxicity study (90 days) (Annex VII, 6.6.2) shall be proposed by the registrant if:

- the frequency and duration of human exposure indicates that a longer term study is appropriate; and one of the following conditions is met:

- other available data indicate that the substance may have a dangerous property that cannot be detected in a short-term toxicity study; or

- appropriately designed toxicokinetic studies reveal accumulation of the substance or its metabolites in certain tissues or organs which would possibly remain undetected in a short-term toxicity study but which are liable to result in adverse effects after prolonged exposure.

Further studies shall be proposed by the registrant or may be required by the competent authority of the evaluating Member State in accordance with Article 39, 40 or 44 in case of:

- failure to identify a NOAEL in the 28 days study, unless the reason for the failure to identify a NOAEL is absence of adverse toxic effects; or

- toxicity of particular concern (e.g., serious/severe effects); or

- the route of exposure used in the initial repeated dose study was inappropriate in relation to the expected route of human exposure and route-to-route extrapolation cannot be made; or

- particular concern regarding exposure (e.g. use in consumer products leading to exposure levels which are close to the dose levels at which toxicity to humans may be expected ); or

// 6.7.2. The study shall be initially performed on one species. A decision on the need to perform a study on a second species should be based on the outcome of the first test.

// The two-generation reproductive toxicity study (Annex VII, 6.7.3) shall be proposed by the registrant if there are indications of potential reproductive toxicity from a repeated dose toxicity study (90 days) (e.g. histopathological effects on the gonads) or the substance has a close structural relationship with a known reproductive toxicant.

ANNEX VIII Additional standard information requirements for substances manufactured or imported in quantities of 1000 tonnes or more

At the level of this Annex, the registrant must submit a proposal and a time schedule for fulfilling the information requirements of this Annex in accordance with Article 11 (1) (d).

Column 1 of this Annex establishes the standard information required for all substances manufactured or imported in quantities of 1000 tonnes or more in accordance with Article 11 (1) (d). Accordingly, the information required in column 1 of this Annex is additional to that required in column 1 of Annexes V, VI and VII. Column 2 of this Annex lists specific rules according to which the registrant may propose to omit the required standard information, replace it by other information, provide it at a later stage or adapt it in another way. If the conditions are met under which column 2 of this Annex allows an adaptation to be proposed, the registrant shall clearly state this fact and the reasons for proposing each adaptation under the appropriate headings in the registration dossier.

In addition to these specific rules, a registrant may propose to adapt the required standard information set out in column 1 of this Annex according to the general rules contained in Annex IX. In this case as well, he shall clearly state the reasons for any decision to propose adaptations to the standard information under the appropriate headings in the registration dossier referring to the appropriate specific rule(s) in column 2 or in Annexes IX or X [72].

[72] Note: conditions for not requiring a specific test that are set out in the appropriate test methods in Annex X itself that are not repeated in column 2, also apply

Before new tests are carried out to determine the properties listed in this Annex, all available in vitro data, in vivo data, historical data, data from valid (Q)SARs and data from structurally related substances (read-across approach) shall be assessed first.

When, for certain endpoints, it is proposed not to provide information for other reasons than those mentioned in column 2 of this Annex or in Annex IX, this fact and the reasons shall also be clearly stated.

- particular concern regarding exposure (e.g. use in consumer products leading to exposure levels which are close to the dose levels at which toxicity is observed).

6.7. Reproductive toxicity //

6.7.4. Two-generation reproductive toxicity study, one species, male and female, most appropriate route of administration, having regard to the likely route of human exposure, unless already provided as part of Annex VII requirements // 6.7.4. The study need not be conducted if:

- the substance is known to be a germ cell mutagen and appropriate risk management measures are implemented; or

- the substance is of low toxicological activity (no evidence of toxicity seen in any of the tests available), it can be proven from toxicokinetic data that no systemic absorption occurs via relevant routes of exposure (e.g. plasma/blood concentrations below detection limit using a sensitive method and absence of the substance and of metabolites of the substance in urine, bile or exhaled air) and there is no or no significant human exposure.

// 6.9. A carcinogenicity study may be proposed or may be required by the competent authority of the evaluating Member State in accordance with Articles 39, 40 or 44 if:

Description of the analytical methods shall be provided on request, for the relevant compartments for which studies were performed using the analytical method concerned. If the analytical methods are not available this shall be justified.

ANNEX IX General rules for adaptation of the standard testing regime set out in Annexes V to VIII

Annexes V to VIII set out the standard testing regime required for all substances manufactured or imported in quantities of:

- 1 tonne or more in accordance with Article 11 (1) (a),

- 10 tonnes or more in accordance with Article 11 (1) (b),

- 100 tonnes or more in accordance with Article 11 (1) (c), and

- 1000 tonnes or more in accordance with Article 11 (1) (d).

In addition to the specific rules set out in Column 2 of Annexes V to VIII, a registrant may adapt the standard testing regime in accordance with the general rules set out in Section 1 of this Annex. Under evaluation competent authorities of evaluating Member States may assess these adaptations to the standard testing regime.

1. Testing does not appear scientifically necessary

1.1. Use of existing data

1.1.1. Data on physical-chemical properties from experiments not carried out according to GLP or Annex X

Data shall be considered to be equivalent to data generated by the corresponding test in Annex X if the following conditions are met:

(1) adequacy for the purpose of classification and labelling and risk assessment, and

(2) adequate and reliable documentation of the study is provided.

1.1.2. Data from animal experiments not carried out according to GLP or Annex X

Data shall be considered to be equivalent to data generated by the corresponding test in Annex X if the following conditions are met:

(1) adequacy for the purpose of classification and labelling and risk assessment,

(2) adequate and reliable coverage of the key parameters foreseen to be investigated in the corresponding test in Annex X,

(3) exposure duration comparable to or longer than the corresponding test in Annex X if exposure duration is a relevant parameter, and

(4) adequate and reliable documentation of the study is provided.

1.1.3. Historical human data

Historical human data, such as epidemiological studies on exposed populations, accidental or occupational exposure data and clinical studies, shall be considered.

The strength of the data for a specific health effect depends, among other things, on the type of analysis and on the parameters covered and on the magnitude and specificity of the response and consequently the predictability of the effect. Criteria for assessing the adequacy of the data include:

(1) the proper selection and characterisation of the exposed and control groups,

(2) adequate characterisation of exposure,

(3) sufficient length of follow-up for disease occurrence,

(4) valid method for observing an effect,

(5) proper consideration of bias and confounding factors, and

(6) a reasonable statistical reliability to justify the conclusion.

In all cases adequate and reliable documentation shall be provided.

1.2. Weight of evidence

There may be sufficient weight of evidence from several independent sources of information leading to the assumption/conclusion that a substance has or has not a particular dangerous property, while the information from each single source alone is regarded insufficient to support this notion.

There may be sufficient weight of evidence from the use of newly developed test methods, not yet included in Annex X, leading to the conclusion that a substance has or has not a particular dangerous property.

Where sufficient weight of evidence for the presence or absence of a particular dangerous property is available:

- further testing on vertebrate animals for that property shall be omitted,

- further testing not involving vertebrate animals may be omitted.

In all cases adequate and reliable documentation shall be provided.

1.3. Structure-activity relationship (SAR)

Results obtained from valid qualitative or quantitative structure-activity relationship models ((Q)SARs) may indicate the presence or absence of a certain dangerous property. Results of (Q)SARs may be used instead of testing when the following conditions are met:

- results are derived from a (Q)SAR model whose scientific validity has been established,

- results are adequate for the purpose of classification and labelling and risk assessment, and

- adequate and reliable documentation of the applied method is provided.

The Agency in collaboration with the Commission, Member States and interested parties shall develop and provide guidance in assessing which (Q)SARs will meet these conditions and provide examples.

1.4. In vitro methods

Results obtained from suitable in vitro methods may indicate the presence of a certain dangerous property. In this context, "suitable" means sufficiently well developed according to internationally agreed test development criteria (e.g. the ECVAM criteria for the entry of a test into the prevalidation process). Depending on the potential risk, immediate confirmation requiring testing beyond the information foreseen in Annex V or VI or proposed confirmation requiring testing beyond the information foreseen in Annex VII or VIII for the respective tonnage level may be necessary.

If the results obtained from the use of such in vitro methods do not indicate a certain dangerous property, the relevant test shall nevertheless be carried out at the appropriate tonnage level to confirm the negative result, unless testing is not required in accordance with Annexes V to VIII or the other rules in Annex IX.

Such confirmation may be waived, if the following conditions are met:

(1) results are derived from an in vitro method whose scientific validity has been established by a validation study, according to internationally agreed validation principles,

(2) results are adequate for the purpose of classification and labelling and risk assessment, and

(3) adequate and reliable documentation of the applied method is provided.

1.5. Grouping of substances and read-across approach

Substances whose physicochemical, toxicological and ecotoxicological properties are likely to be similar or follow a regular pattern as a result of structural similarity may be considered as a group, or "category" of substances. Application of the group concept requires that physicochemical properties, human health effects and environmental effects or environmental fate may be predicted from data for a reference substance within the group by interpolation to other substances in the group (read-across approach). This avoids the need to test every substance for every endpoint.

The similarities may be based on:

(1) a common functional group,

(2) the common precursors and/or the likelihood of common breakdown products via physical and biological processes, which result in structurally similar chemicals, or

(3) a constant pattern in the changing of the potency of the properties across the category.

If the group concept is applied, substances shall be classified and labelled on this basis.

In all cases adequate and reliable documentation shall be provided.

2. Testing is technically not possible

Testing for a specific endpoint may be omitted, if it is technically not possible to conduct the study as a consequence of the properties of the substance: e.g. very volatile, highly reactive or unstable substances cannot be used, mixing of the substance with water may cause danger of fire or explosion or the radio-labelling of the substance required in certain studies may not be possible. The guidance given in the test guidelines of Annex X, more specifically on the technical limitations of a specific method, shall always be respected.

3. substance-tailored exposure-driven testing

Testing in accordance with Annexes VII and VIII may be omitted, based on the exposure scenario(s) developed in the Chemical Safety Report.

In all cases, adequate justification and documentation shall be provided.

ANNEX XI General provisions for Downstream Users to Assess substances and prepare Chemical safety reports

Introduction

The purpose of this Annex is to set out how downstream users are to assess and document that the risks arising from the substance(s) they use are adequately controlled during their use for a use not covered by the safety data sheet supplied to them and that other users further down the supply chain can adequately control the risks. The assessment shall cover the life-cycle of the substance, from its receipt by the downstream user, for his own uses and for his identified uses further down the supply chain. The assessment shall consider the use of the substance on its own, in a preparation or in an article.

In carrying out the chemical safety assessment and producing the Chemical Safety Report, the downstream user shall take account of information received in the Safety Data Sheet from the supplier of the chemical in accordance with Article 29 of this Regulation. Where available and appropriate, an assessment carried out under Community legislation, (e.g. risk assessments completed under Regulation 793/93) shall be taken into account in the chemical safety assessment and be reflected in the Chemical Safety Report. Deviations from such assessments shall be justified. Assessments carried out under other international and national programmes may also be taken into account.

The process which the downstream user goes through in carrying out the chemical safety assessment and in producing his Chemical Safety Report, involves three steps:

Step 1: Development of exposure scenario(s)

The downstream user shall develop exposure scenarios for uses not covered in a safety data sheet supplied to him in accordance with Section 5 of Annex I.

Step 2: If necessary, a refinement of the hazard assessment by the supplier;

If the downstream user considers the assessments reported in the Safety Data Sheet supplied to him to be appropriate, then no further hazard assessment or PBT and vPvB assessment is necessary. In this case he shall use the relevant information reported by the supplier for the risk characterisation. This shall be stated in the chemical safety report.

If the downstream user considers the assessments reported in the Safety Data Sheet supplied to him to be inappropriate, then he shall carry out the relevant assessments in accordance with Annex I, sections 1 through 4 as appropriate to him.

In those cases where the downstream user considers that information in addition to that provided by the supplier is necessary for producing his Chemical Safety Report the downstream user shall gather this information. Where this information can only be obtained by testing on vertebrate animals, he shall submit a proposal for a testing strategy to the Agency in accordance with Article 35. He shall explain why he considers that additional information is necessary. While waiting for results of further testing, he shall record the risk management measures he has put in place.

On completion of any additional testing, the downstream user shall revise the Chemical Safety Report, and his Safety Data Sheet, as appropriate.

Step 3: Risk characterisation.

A risk characterisation shall be carried out for each new exposure scenario as prescribed in section 6 of Annex I. The risk characterisation shall be presented under the relevant heading of the Chemical Safety Report and summarised in the Safety Data Sheet under the relevant heading(s).

In these steps, iterations may be made between on the one hand developing new exposure scenario, which entails developing and implementing or recommending risk management measures, and on the other hand generating further information. The purpose of generating further information is to establish a more precise risk characterisation, based on a refined hazard assessment and/or exposure assessment.

The downstream user shall produce a Chemical Safety Report detailing his chemical safety assessment using part C, sections 5 and 6, of the format set out in Section 7 of Annex I and the other sections of this format, if appropriate.

Part A of the Chemical Safety Report shall include a declaration that the risk management measures outlined in the relevant exposure scenarios are implemented by the downstream user for his own uses and that the risk management measures outlined in the exposure scenarios for the identified uses are communicated down the supply chain.

ANNEX XII Criteria for the identification of Persistent, Bioaccumulative and Toxic Substances, and Very Persistent and Very Bioaccumulative Substances

This Annex lays down the criteria for the identification of:

i) persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic substances (PBT-substances), and

ii) very persistent and very bioaccumulative substances (vPvB-substances).

A substance is identified as a PBT substance if it fulfils the criteria in Sections 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3. A substance is identified as a vPvB substance if it fulfils the criteria in Sections 2.1 and 2.2. This annex shall not apply to inorganic substances, but shall apply to organo-metals.

1. PBT-substances

A substance that fulfils all three of the criteria of the sections below is a PBT substance.

- the half-life in marine sediment is higher than 180 days, or

- the half-life in fresh- or estuarine water sediment is higher than 120 days, or

- the half-life in soil is higher than 120 days.

The assessment of the persistency in the environment shall be based on available half-life data collected under the adequate conditions, which shall be described by the registrant.

1.2. Bioaccumulation

A substance fulfils the bioaccumulation criterion (B-) when:

- the bioconcentration factor (BCF) is higher than 2000.

The assessment of bioaccumulation shall be based on measured data on bioconcentration in aquatic species. Data from freshwater as well as marine water species can be used.

1.3. Toxicity

A substance fulfils the toxicity criterion (T-) when:

- the long-term no-observed effect concentration (Noec) for marine or freshwater organisms is less than 0.01 mg/l, or

- the substance is classified as carcinogenic (category 1 or 2), mutagenic (category 1 or 2), or toxic for reproduction (category 1, 2, or 3), or

- there is other evidence of chronic toxicity, as identified by the classifications: T, R48, or Xn, R48 according to Directive 67/548/EEC.

2. vPvB - substances

A substance that fulfils the criteria of the sections below is a vPvB substance.

2.1. Persistence

A substance fulfils the very persistence criterion (vP-) when:

- the half-life in marine, fresh- or estuarine water is higher than 60 days, or

- the half-life in marine, fresh- or estuarine water sediment is higher than 180 days, or

- the half-life in soil is higher than 180.

2.2. Bioaccumulation

A substance fulfils the very bioaccumulative criterion (vB-) when:

- the bioconcentration factor is greater than 5000.

.

ANNEX XIV dossiers

The purpose of this Annex is to lay down general principles for Member States to submit and justify proposals for restrictions, harmonised classification and labelling or identification of a substance as a PBT, a vPvB, or a substance of equivalent concern on a Community-wide basis.

Content of dossiers

Part A - Proposal

This shall include details of:

a) the restriction(s) proposed including the substance(s) concerned and the manufacture, use(s) and/or placing on the market affected, or

b) the substance(s) concerned and the harmonised classification and labelling proposed, or

c) the substance(s) concerned and whether it is proposed to be identified as a PBT according to Article 54(d), a vPvB according to Article 54(e), or a substance of equivalent concern according to Article 54(f).

Part B - Technical and Scientific Basis

An assessment of the hazard or risk, which demonstrates that action on a Community wide basis is necessary beyond any measures that are already in place. This shall be presented according to the format set out in Part B of the Chemical Safety Report in Annex I and, as appropriate, using the methodology set out in that Annex.

For a restrictions proposal, the relevant parts of Annex I needed to support the proposal shall be completed.

For a classification and labelling proposal, the relevant parts of Section 1 needed to support the proposal shall be completed.

For a proposal to identify a substance as a PBT or a vPvB, the relevant parts of Sections 1-4 needed to support the proposal shall be completed.

Member States shall consider any relevant data from registration dossiers and may use any information available. Statements regarding lack of relevant information are not required.

For information which has not been previously submitted to the Agency and that is used in the dossier, a robust study summary shall be prepared and submitted to the Agency in the format specified by the Agency in accordance with Article 108.

The dossier may consider emissions of the substance from any source.

The dossier may develop exposure scenarios, which take into account the actual risk management measures in place.

The dossier shall contain scientific justification of any grouping of substances.

The Member State submitting the dossier shall, on request, provide the Agency or the Commission with any or all information on which the dossier was based or to which reference is made in the dossier.

Part C - Justification for Action at Community Level

a) Evidence that implemented risk management measures (including those identified in registrations under Articles 9 to 13) are not sufficient.

b) Justification for the proposal that action is required on a Community-wide basis.

c) Identification of the available options for addressing the concerns identified in Part B. For restrictions, this includes evidence that alternative substances and/or processes have been considered in the preparation of the proposal.

d) Identification of the administrative, legal or other tools by which the available options can be implemented.

e) Justification for the option and implementation method selected. The options shall be evaluated using the following criteria:

i) effectiveness: the action must be targeted to the effects or exposures that cause the risks identified and must be capable of reducing these risks to a level where the risk is adequately controlled within a reasonable period of time;

ii) practicality: the action must be implementable, enforceable and manageable. Priority should be given to those measures that can be implemented with the existing infrastructure;

iii) monitorability: the ability to monitor the result of the implementation of the proposed action;

iv) a socio-economic assessment may be made of the impact of the proposed action on the producers/importers and/or downstream users of the substance and on other parties. This assessment should follow Annex XV.

Part D - Other Information

a) A statement about which interested parties have been consulted about the proposed action and, if appropriate, how their views have been taken into account.

b) Other relevant information.

ANNEX XV socio-economic analysis

This Annex outlines the information that may be addressed by those submitting a socio-economic analysis (SEA) with an application for authorisation, as specified in Article 59 (5) (a), or in connection with a proposed restriction, as specified in Article 66(3)(b).

The Agency shall prepare guidance for the preparation of SEAs. SEAs, or contributions to them, shall be submitted in the format specified by the Agency in accordance with Article 108.

However, the level of detail and scope of the SEA, or contributions to them, shall be the responsibility of the applicant for authorisation, or, in the case of a proposed restriction, the interested party. The information provided can address the socio-economic impacts at any level.

An SEA may include the following elements:

- Impact of a granted or refused authorisation on the applicant(s), or, in the case of a proposed restriction, the impact on industry (e.g. manufacturers and importers). The impact on all other actors in the supply chain, downstream users and associated businesses in terms of commercial consequences such as impact on investment, one-off and operating costs (e.g. compliance; transitional arrangements; changes to existing processes, reporting and monitoring systems; installation of new technology etc).

- Impacts of a granted or refused authorisation, or a proposed restriction, on consumers. For example, product prices, changes in composition or quality or performance of products, availability of products, consumer choice.

- Social implications of a granted or refused authorisation, or a proposed restriction. For example job security and employment.

- Availability, suitability, and technical feasibility of alternatives, and economic consequences thereof, and information on the rates of, and potential for, technological change in the sector(s) concerned. In the case of an application for authorisation, the social and/or economic impacts of using any available alternatives identified in Article 59(5)(b).

- Wider implications on trade, competition and economic development (in particular SMEs) of a granted or refused authorisation, or a proposed restriction. This may include consideration of local, regional, national or international aspects.

- In the case of a proposed restriction, proposals for other regulatory or non-regulatory measures that could meet the aim of the proposed restriction (this shall take account of existing legislation). This should include an assessment of the costs linked to alternative risk management measures.

- In the case of a proposed restriction, the social and economic benefits of the proposed restriction. For example, worker health, environmental performance and the distribution of these benefits, for example, geographically, population groups.

- An SEA may also address any other issue that is considered to be relevant by the applicant(s) or interested party.

Appendices 1 o 6

Foreword

Explanations of column headings

Substances:

The name is the same as that used for the substance in Annex I to Council Directive 67/548/EEC. Whenever possible dangerous substances are designated by their EINECS (European Inventory of Existing Commercial Chemical Substances) or ELINCS (European List of Notified Chemical Substances) names. These are refered to as EC numbers in the table. Other entries not listed in EINECS or ELINCS are designated using an internationally recognized chemical name (e.g. ISO, IUPAC). An additional common name is included in some cases.

Index number:

The index number is the identification code given to the substance in Annex I of Directive 67/548/EEC. Substances are listed in the Appendix according to this index number.

EINECS number:

For each substance listed in the European Inventory of Existing Commercial Chemical Substances (EINECS) there is an identification code. The code starts at 200-001-8.

ELINCS number

For each new substance notified under the Directive 67/548/EEC an identification code has been defined and published in the European List of Notified Chemical Substances (ELINCS). The code starts at 400-010-9.

CAS number:

Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) numbers have been defined for substances to help in their identification.

Notes:

The full text of the notes can be found in the foreword of Annex I of Directive 67/548/EEC.

The notes to be taken into account for the purposes of this Regulation are as follows:

97/56/EC Art. 1 point 2 (adapted)

Note C :

Some organic substances may be markketed either in a specific isomeric form or as a mixture of several isomers.

Note D :

Certain substances which are susceptible to spontaneous polymerisation or decomposition are generally placed on the market in a stabilised form. It is in this form that they are listed in annex I to Directive 67/548/EEC.

However, such substances are sometimes placed on the market in a non-stabilised form. In this case, the manufacturer or any person who places such a substance on the market must state on the label the name of the substance followed by the words 'non-stabilised'.

Note E :

Substances with specific effects on human health (see chapter 4 of Annex VI of Directive 67/548/EEC) that are classified as carcinogenic, mutagenic and/or toxic for reproduction in categories 1 or 2 are ascribed Note E if they are also classified as very toxic (T+), toxic (T) or harmful (Xn). For these substances, the risk phrases R20, R21, R22, R23, R24, R25, R26, R27, R28, R39, R68 (harmful), R48 and R65 and all combinations of these risk phrases shall be preceded by the word 'Also'.

Note J:

The classification as a carcinogen need not apply if it can be shown that the substance contains less than 0,1 % w/w benzene (EINECS No 200-753-7).

Note K:

The classification as a carcinogen need not apply if it can be shown that the substance contains less than 0,1 % w/w 1,3-butadiene (EINECS No 203-450-8).

Note L:

The classification as a carcinogen need not apply if it can be shown that the substance contains less than 3 % DMSO extract as measured by IP 346.

Note M:

The classification as a carcinogen need not apply if it can be shown that the substance contains less than 0,005 % w/w benzo[a]-pyrene (EINECS No 200-028-5).

Note N:

The classification as a carcinogen need not apply if the full refining history is known and it can be shown that the substance from which it is produced is not a carcinogen.

Note P:

The classification as a carcinogen need not apply if it can be shown that the substance contains less than 0,1 % w/w benzene (EINECS No 200-753-7).

2001/41/EC Art. 1 point 1 (adapted)

Note R:

The classification as a carcinogen need not apply to fibres with a length weighted geometric mean diameter, less two standard errors, greater than 6ìm.

Note S :

This substance may not require a label according to Article 23 (see section 8 of Annex VI) of Directive 67/548/EEC

- the top part (h1=40% H) shall include the letter «a» in white, on a black background,

- the bottom part (h2=60% H) shall include the standard wording in white and/or black, on a red background, and shall be clearly legible;

(c) if the article contains crocidolite, the words «contains asbestos» used in the standard wording shall be replaced by «contains crocidolite/blue asbestos».

Member States may exclude from the provision of the first subparagraph hereof article intended to be placed on the market in their territory. The labelling of these article must however bear the wording "contains asbestos"(d) if labelling takes the form of direct printing on the articles , a single colour contrasting with the background colour is sufficient.

&gt;REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC&gt;

2. The label mentioned in this Annex shall be affixed in accordance with the following rules:

(a) on each of the smallest units supplied;

(b) if an article has asbestos-based components, it is sufficient for these components only to bear the label. The labelling may be dispensed with if smallness of size or unsuitability of packaging make it impossible for a label to be affixed to the component.

3. Labelling of packaged articles containing asbestos

3.1. The following particulars shall appear on clearly legible and indelible labelling on the packaging of packaged articles containing asbestos:

(a) the symbol and relevant indications of danger in accordance with this Annex;

(b) safety instructions which must be selected in accordance with the particulars in this Annex, inasmuch as they are relevant for the particular article .

Where additional safety information is provided on the packaging, this shall not weaken or contradict the particulars given in accordance with (a) and (b).

3.2. Labelling in accordance with 3.1 shall be effected by means of:

- a label firmly affixed to the packaging, or

- a (tie-on) label securely attached to the package, or

- direct printing of the packaging.

3.3. Articles containing asbestos and which are packaged only in loose plastic wrapping or the like shall be regarded as packaged articles and shall be labelled in accordance with 3.2. If articles are separated from such packages and placed on the market unpackaged, each of the smallest units supplied shall be accompanied by labelling particulars in accordance with 3.1.

4. Labelling of unpackaged articles containing asbestos

For unpackaged articles containing asbestos, labelling in accordance with 3.1 shall be effected by means of:

- a label firmly affixed to the article containing asbestos,

- a (tie-on) label securely attached to such an article ,

- direct printing on the articles,

or, if the abovementioned is not reasonably practicable as in the case of, for example, smallness of size of the article , the unsuitable nature of the article's properties or certain technical difficulties by means of a hand-out with labelling in accordance with 3.1.

5. Without prejudice to Community provisions on safety and hygiene at work, the label affixed to the article which may, in the context of its use, be processed or finished, shall be accompanied by any safety instructions which may be appropriate for the article concerned, and in particular by the following:

- operate if possible out of doors or in a well-ventilated place,

- preferably use hand tools or low-speed tools equipped, if necessary, with an appropriate dust-extraction facility. If high-speed tools are used, they should always be equipped with such a facility,

- if possible, dampen before cutting or drilling,

- dampen dust and place it in a properly closed receptacle and dispose of it safely.

LEGISLATIVE FINANCIAL STATEMENT

Policy area(s): 02 - ENTERPRISE

Activit(y/ies): 04 - GETTING STILL MORE FROM THE INTERNAL MARKET

Title of action: 04 - FUTURE CHEMICALS LEGISLATION (REACH) AND THE CREATION OF A CHEMICALS AGENCY

1. BUDGET LINE(S) + HEADING(S)

New line - Future chemicals legislation (REACH) and creation of a Chemicals Agency

2. OVERALL FIGURES

2.1. Total allocation for action (Part B): EUR million for commitment

Over the 11years period of the action, the EC contribution in the form of a balancing subsidy is estimated at EUR 78.8 million or about 22% of the total budget of the Agency (Annex 1, 2).

2.2. Period of application:

The duration of the action is 11 years (2006 - 2016). The bulk of the work envisaged in the future chemicals legislation (REACH) for the Agency is the registration of so-called "phase-in" (or "existing") substances. This should be finalised within 11 years of entry into force of the legislation. Thereafter the Agency will continue to carry out its functions (with a smaller staff) with regard to the registration of new substances and providing technical and scientific guidance to the Commission, Member States and industry.

The indicative timetable (assuming that the Regulation enters into force in 2006) is as follows:

&gt;TABLE POSITION&gt;

2.3. Overall multiannual estimate of expenditure:

(a) Schedule of commitment appropriations/payment appropriations (financial intervention) (see point 6.1.1)

EUR million (to three decimal places)

&gt;TABLE POSITION&gt;

(b) Technical and administrative assistance and support expenditure (see point 6.1.2)

&gt;TABLE POSITION&gt;

(c) Overall financial impact of human resources and other administrative expenditure (see points 7.2 and 7.3)

&gt;TABLE POSITION&gt;

* 2004 and 2005 are only considered for information purposes, since the Regulation will enter into force the earliest by January 2006. However, a number of preparatory actions are required to ensure that the new Chemicals Agency is operational on that date.

2.4. Compatibility with financial programming and financial perspective

[X] Proposal will entail reprogramming of the relevant heading in the financial perspective.

2.5. Financial impact on revenue:

[X]* Proposal has no financial implications (involves technical aspects regarding implementation of a measure)

There is no impact on the revenue side of the Community budget. The Agency's budget foresees its own revenues consisting of the fees paid by industry for registration and authorisation, which the Agency is authorised to collect by virtue of the tasks entrusted to it, and a balancing subsidy from the Community budget.

Because of the concern regarding the variation in fee income and consequently the required EC balancing subsidy, the Agency should be allowed, in accordance with Article185 of the Commission Financial Regulation [73] to foresee, after Commission's prior consent, in its own financial regulation the creation of a reserve fund made up of excess fee income.

Article95 of the Treaty is the appropriate legal basis because of the need to ensure a level playing field for all economic actors in the Internal Market while at the same time ensuring a high level of protection of health and the environment.

5. DESCRIPTION AND GROUNDS

5.1. Need for Community intervention

REACH

On 27February2001 the Commission issued a White Paper [74] on a Strategy for a future Chemicals Policy.

[74] COM(2001) 88 Final

The need for a new strategy arose from wide acceptance that the existing legislation was not capable of responding adequately to public concern in Europe about the potential impact of chemicals on health and the environment, and would be increasingly unable to meet expectations in the future.

The existing legislation, while introducing a considerable number of risk reduction measures for certain dangerous substances, was seen as unsuited to the requirements of the new century. In particular, it did not make sufficient information available about the properties of "existing" chemicals (first marketed before 1981), which dominate the Community market, it was failing to deliver risk assessments and subsequent restrictions needed within a reasonable timeframe, and it placed too much onus on public authorities to provide proof of risk. The fact that the requirements for putting new chemicals on the market were much stricter than those applied to "existing" chemicals was a further important argument in favour of modernising the system.

Agency

The Agency will be an independent authority for the management of the new Reach system and will be a key player in ensuring that the system has credibility with all stakeholders and the public. In the interests of efficiency, continuity and optimum use of available resources, it has been assumed that Ispra, Italy (present site of the European Chemicals Bureau) will be the most appropriate site for the Agency.

The added value of Community involvement through the new chemicals Agency will be achieved through the centralised gathering of information on chemicals [not existing to date]. This information will provide a sound basis for decisions to be taken by the Commission and non-confidential data will be made available to all interested stakeholders on request or on a database. In addition, the Agency will serve as a central point for the exchange of information among the Competent Authorities (CAs) of the Member States and ensure that best practices are shared.

The Commission will have the power to take all decisions in relation to authorisation and restriction of dangerous substances by means of the Commitology procedure based on opinions prepared by the Agency. The Commission shall also take decisions on proposals for further testing (if Member States cannot reach an agreement), the inclusion of substances into the authorisation system, as well as on harmonisation of classification and labelling.

5.1.1. Objectives pursued

REACH objectives

The Commission's strategy for a future chemicals policy is part of its wider sustainable development strategy. Its overriding goal is therefore to respect sustainable development by ensuring both a high level of protection of human health and the environment and the competitiveness of the chemicals industry, within the framework of the Single Market. The specific objectives of REACH are:

- protection of human health and the environment;

- maintenance and enhancement of the competitiveness of the EU chemical industry;

- prevent fragmentation of the internal market;

- increased transparency;

- integration with international efforts;

- promotion of non-animal testing;

- conformity with EU international obligations under the WTO.

Agency's objectives

The Agency shall co-ordinate the resources of Member States competent authorities under the Reach system. This co-ordination role, as opposed to giving the Agency a role as a pan-European regulator, is consistent with the principle of subsidiarity.

The Agency will submit opinions to the Commission prior to decisions being taken. In order to ensure that complete dossiers can be submitted to the Member States, the Agency will be entrusted with the power to request additional information.

Furthermore, the concerned parties will be informed about opinions to be issued and will be allowed to comment on them. The comments will be forwarded to the Commission along with the opinions, thus safeguarding the parties' rights of defence.

Indicators

Due to a lack of data, a comprehensive quantitative assessment of the impacts of chemicals on the environment and human health is not possible. Indeed, much of this information will only be available after the chemicals on the market today have been registered in line with the requirements of REACH. Accordingly, the benefits of REACH will occur over a longer time frame.

The impact assessment carried out for the proposed chemicals strategy demonstrates that the Commission's legislative proposal represents a balanced approach. It will:

i) contribute to improved health for the citizens of the EU and greater protection of the environment

ii) bring added benefits to worker safety and

iii) improve the conditions for innovation, by making it easier and cheaper to develop new and safer substances; and, also by limiting costs help to maintain the competitiveness of the chemicals industry.

It will be necessary to keep all the different impacts resulting from the new Policy (see the Impact Assessment document) under close review in order to make sure that the implementation of the new legislation will result in a balanced outcome as required by the sustainable development approach. In order to do so a set of indicators have been identified and anticipated in the Impact Assessment:

Objective // Indicators for the policy

Protection of human health and the environment // * Member States' reports on the dossier evaluations of testing proposals conducted over the previous year [75]

[75] Article 51 of the Regulation stipulates ' Obligations for Member States to report to the Agency - In the interests of ensuring that the burden is fairly shared, every Member States shall prepare a report annually on the dossier evaluations of testing proposals conducted over the previous year'.

* Number of animal tests conducted following dossier evaluation

* Number of proposals for animal tests rejected after dossier evaluation

* Member States' reports on enforcement activities [76]

[76] Article 123 of the Regulation stipulates 'Report - This requires Member States to report on their enforcement activities and the sanctions imposed for non-compliance over the previous calendar year. This information will be useful to the Forum in identifying any action that might usefully be taken at Community level'.

* Number of PBTs [77], vPvBs [78] and CMRs [79] identified

[77] Persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic substances

[78] very persistent and very bioaccumulative substances

[79] Carcinogenic, mutagenic and reprotoxic substances

Harmonisation of evaluation system // * Number of draft evaluation decisions referred to the Member State Committee in the Agency

Maintenance and enhancement of the competitiveness of the EU chemical industry // * Number of companies active in the chemicals sector (including share of SMEs)

* Development of exports/imports of the European chemicals industry

* GDP contribution of the chemicals sector and value added

* Level of employment in the chemicals sector

Promotion of innovation // * Number of new substances registered

* Number of PPORDs [80] applied for

[80] Product and Process Oriented Development

* Numbers of request for information for non-confidential data

Promotion of non-animal testing // * Availability of valid QSARs [81]

[81] Qualitative structure activity relationships (alternative testing method)

* Number of in-vitro test methods developed

* Number of vertebrate test animals used in relation to number of tests performed

Conformity with EU international obligations under the WTO // * Number of TBT [82] cases

[82] Technical barriers to trade

Timely introduction of risk reduction measures // * Number of authorisation/restriction cases dealt with

* Time from receiving a complete dossier to appropriate risk reduction measures being agreed

Cost-effectiveness of centralised registration process // * Number of registration dossiers received from industry

* Number of refused registration dossiers (completeness check)

Accuracy of Agency decision making // * Number of appeals received

* Number of appeals uphold

Before REACH comes into force a 'base-line' study will be conducted to identify

* Incidence and type of chemical induced ill-health in relation to

- consumers (public)

- workers (general)

- workers (chemical industry)

* Incidence and type of environmental damage caused by chemicals

This base-line study will also identify relevant social and economic factors that may impact on them. The same indicators and methodology will be used every n-years to identify changes in these incidents as well as the social and economic factors identified in the base-line study.

5.1.2. Measures taken in connection with ex ante evaluation

The proposed legislation is a more comprehensive approach involving many added features but does in several areas have strong similarities to previous Community policies. Therefore, for the purpose of this exercise it is possible to draw on experiences of the past and particularly upon the knowledge and skills held within the ECB such as the time needed to perform different tasks and the identification of when further testing is necessary. It is the intention to harness this experience within the preparatory phases for REACH (see section 5.2.) so that when the new legislation is in place the appropriate Agency tasks can begin immediately.

REACH

Different studies have supported the Commission in developing a cost-effective and balanced strategy. These studies are available on the Commission website [83].

[83] http://europa.eu.int/comm/enterprise/ chemicals/chempol/bia/index.htm

Stakeholders have been consulted continuously from the early stages of the development of the legislation.

Even before the White Paper was adopted, an initial brainstorming meeting was held in February 1999 with more than 150 stakeholders - regulators, scientists, industry, environmental and consumer NGOs as well as representatives from applicant countries. -This helped to provide the Commission with an overall view of the problems with the current system and potential solutions.

Subsequent to the publication of the White Paper, there followed a period of considerable public discussion, including hundreds of written comments from stakeholders on a range of issues linked to the proposed new system. This exchange of views took place in the course of conferences, stakeholder working groups and bilateral contacts between the services and stakeholders. Specific studies, notably in relation to the likely impact of the system proposed, were also initiated.

Both the Council of Ministers and the Parliament adopted conclusions on the White Paper and, in addition, several Member States and certain third countries, such as the United States, made known their views separately.

In May 2003, the Commission decided to launch an Internet consultation to consider the workability of the draft legislation, including the technical requirements. The consultation took place between 15 May and 10 July 2003. More than 6000 contributions were received. More information on the Internet consultation and the other stakeholder consultations is available on the Commission website [84].

[84] http://europa.eu.int/comm/enterprise/ chemicals/chempol/whitepaper/whitepaper.htm

Agency

Two options were considered for the establishment of a new "Entity" to administer REACH. One option is the setting up an independent Agency, the other is to enlarge the European Chemicals Bureau (ECB). In order to evaluate both alternatives, a study was carried out [85]. Having fully considered the available options the Commission has come to the conclusion that setting up an independent Agency is the preferred option.

[85] See 'Feasibility study on resource requirements for a Central Entity', Commission financed study carried-out by Deloitte & Touche (final report June 2002). In the White Paper on the strategy of a future chemicals policy, the Commission proposed a feasibility study on this entity. This study considered two main options: an enlarged European Chemicals Bureau (ECB) within the Commission's Joint Research Centre and an independent central agency.

The main advantages are:

full support for an Agency by all stakeholders and more assured commitment therefore to making the new strategy work;

funding: an independent agency can use fee income to fund staff posts whereas an enlarged ECB could not. The ECB would have to receive the fees into a dedicated line in part B of the Community budget;

external transparency: greater confidence by stakeholders in Agency as instrument of greater transparency;

long-term continuity;

administrative efficiency: the ECB has essentially a scientific background and mandate and is therefore not best suited to carry out largely administrative responsibilities;

more active involvement of Member States in terms of resources, commitment, and harmonisation of controls.

5.1.3. Measures taken following ex-post evaluation

The proposed legislation is a new piece of legislation and does only partially replace existing legislation. Therefore, an ex-post evaluation of previous legislation/programmes is not possible and can not be applied.

5.2. Actions envisaged and budget intervention arrangements

5.2.1 Objectives

Interim period

In the so-called "interim period", starting when the shape of the new Agency has been defined by the proposed Regulation (assumed end 2003) and continuing throughout 2004 and 2005, different preparatory actions will be required to be able to effectively and efficiently administer the new chemicals legislation when it enters into force.

Transition period

After the adoption of the legislative package, the Agency will be in the so-called 'transition period', during which the Commission will fulfil the role of the Agency. This option has been chosen to ensure that the Agency can be operational and is in a position to hire staff and take decisions. [86]

[86] Past experiences of creating other Agencies have shown that without a transitional period it is very difficult to hire staff and to become operational before an Executive Director is in place.

Agency fully operational

Article 73 of the Regulation stipulates that the Agency shall advise the Member States and the Community within the context of the Reach System.

5.2.2 Tasks

Interim period

The key tasks for the task force during the interim period relate to a sound preparation of an (IT) infrastructure for the Agency and the preparation of technical guidance documents for the parties involved. Due to the large number of expected registrations (for about 30,000 substances), a semi-automated registration system is envisioned, largely relying on state-of-the-art IT infrastructure.

It will furthermore be necessary to draft detailed guidance documents for industry and the Competent Authorities of the Member States to ensure that correct and complete files are submitted when the legislation comes into force. In addition, information sessions as part of the educational process will be required for the stakeholders (industry and CAs).

All tasks (including preparing tools for industry to facilitate the registration process and tools developed for Member States to perform their tasks) will be identified in close co-operation and on the basis of a yearly work programme between DGs Environment, Enterprise and the JRC. In addition, the European Chemicals Bureau (ECB) of the JRC will continue to provide scientific and technical support to DG ENV for the implementation of the current legislation, until this legislation is revoked by REACH. The ECB support to current legislation and the support for the preparation of the new legislation for the period 2004-2006 will be provided to the extent allowed by available resources. The work will be re-prioritised, in order to increasingly free up resources for carrying out the preparatory work for REACH. When the new legislation is in place these activities will cease, releasing these posts to be used in other areas of the JRC work programme.

Transition period

The proposed Regulation foresees that the Commission shall fulfil the functions of the Agency during the period following the entry into force of the Regulation until these functions are transferred to the Agency. Given the importance of continuity in chemicals regulation the Commission proposes that the Agency should have its seat in the same location as the present European Chemicals Bureau (ISPRA). In order to perform these functions a core of experienced staff will have to be recruited. The preliminary draft budget of the Agency is based on a total staff level of 95 in year 1 to an average of 200 for the remaining years (Annex 4), except for year 11 [87] (where there will be an exceptionally high workload). In order to ensure that this amount of staff can be hired, a mix of different contract types is anticipated: seconded officials, contract agents, newly recruited officials.

[87] In year 11 the staff requirements peak due to an additional ~170 of C grades, who will be required to up-load registration dossiers into the system. This work can be carried out by interim staff since it requires very little qualifications (hence very short training required) and is limited in time.

An analysis of the profile requirements has been carried out. It is anticipated that during the transition period officials will be seconded by the involved Commission Services to carry out overhead tasks (e.g. HR, Finance/Audit, etc.). For tasks of a more technical nature related to the core (scientific) tasks of the Agency it is anticipated to work with contract agents and newly recruited officials (EPSO is preparing a scientific councours for 2004 which whould yield a reserve list in 2005).

5.3. Methods of implementation

The proposal contains the establishment of an Agency for an initial period of 11 years. The Agency will have a legal personality.

The Agency will be established in accordance with the guidelines contained in the Commission's Communication for Regulatory Agencies [88].

[88] COM(2002) 718 Final

The Agency will comprise the following elements:

- A Management Board of 15 members;

- An Executive Director, reporting to the Management Board;

- A Committee on risk assessment, a Committee on socio-economic analysis and a Member State Committee. These Committees may be asked to provide opinions under the evaluation, authorisation and restriction procedures.

- A Forum for exchange of information on enforcement activities. This Forum implements the White Paper proposal to create a formal network of enforcement authorities. The tasks of the Forum are essentially a continuation of those previously undertaken by an informal network of Member States authorities. Work in this area would benefit from operating in a more formal framework. Each Member State shall nominate a member to the Forum.

- A Secretariat that will provide technical and administrative support for the Committees. It will also undertake a number of tasks without reference to the Committees. These are essentially administrative tasks, requiring limited technical knowledge. Involving the Committees would overburden them and would provide no added value.

- A Board of Appeal that will consider any appeals against the decisions of the Agency.

The budget procedure will be detailed in the following Articles concerning the Agency:

Articles 74, 79, 80, 93, 94, 97, 115.

6. FINANCIAL IMPACT

The Agency budget comprises its own revenues, consisting of all fees, which the Agency is authorised to collect by virtue of the tasks entrusted to it, and a balancing subsidy from the Community budget. The provisional budget (Annex1,2) for the new chemicals Agency assumes that the first two years (2006 and 2007) will be almost entirely financed by the Community budget. Since the Agency's own revenues in the two first years are insignificant, a substantial balancing subsidy is indispensable in order to ensure that the Agency becomes operational as soon as possible after entry into force of the new chemicals legislation (Article130). Over the 11years period, the EC contribution in the form of a balancing subsidy is assumed to cover about 22% of the total budget of the Agency (see Annex1).

As regards the Agency's own revenues, the provisional budget is based on different assumptions (Annex 3) concerning the:

- number of registrations, evaluations and authorisations required under the new legislation;

- repartition over the 11 years period of the registrations, evaluations and authorisations;

- workload for the Agency per single registration, evaluation (to a small extent only, the majority of the work will be carried-out by Member States) and authorisation;

- fee levels per registration, evaluation and authorisation dossier.

For the purpose of the provisional budget, proposals are hereby made with regard to the different fee levels. Once the Commission has transferred the functions foreseen under this Regulation to the Agency, and in order to evaluate the adequacy of future funding, the Management Board will decide on fee levels (Article95). The estimated fee levels are:

- Registration of substances below 100t =&gt; EUR400

- Registration of substances above 100t =&gt; EUR8000

- Dossier evaluation of substances above 100t =&gt; the Agency will reimburse up to EUR5000 of the registration fee received to Competent Authorities (CA) of Member States that will carry out the evaluations (note: substance evaluations are not reimbursed).

Authorisation fee of EUR 50.000

7. IMPACT ON STAFF AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENDITURE

7.1. Impact on human resources

&gt;TABLE POSITION&gt;

After the entry into force of the new legislation, one of the major tasks of the Agency will be the preparation of opinions, which will then be adopted through the Commitology procedure. It is anticipated, that the number of opinions to be expected will create an extra burden on DG ENTR and ENV. Current estimates are that 4 desk officers (A-grades) will be required (3 in DG ENTR and 1 in DG ENV). These resources will have to be covered through internal redeployment in DG ENV and ENTR. In addition, a financial officer (B-grade) will be required to follow up and monitor the activities of the new Chemicals Agency. Also this resource will have to be covered through internal redeployment.

&gt;TABLE POSITION&gt;

8. FOLLOW-UP AND EVALUATION

8.1. Follow-up arrangements

It will be necessary to keep all the different impacts resulting from the new Policy (see for all details the Impact Assessment document) under close review in order to make sure that the implementation of the new legislation will result in a balanced outcome as required by the sustainable development approach. It will be important to monitor how the chemicals industry in particular fulfil the new requirements and it should be ensured that there is full cooperation with industry and SMEs in particular in facilitating an understanding the practical application of the requirements of REACH. The Commission will closely observe the industry's competitiveness, its environmental performance and any variations in employment over time.

Similarly, it will be necessary also to maintain close consultation with other stakeholders, such as environmental NGOs and consumer representatives, which will require the Commission to ensure that REACH is effectively implemented and delivers the anticipated gains to health and the environment.

In order to facilitate evidence-based evaluation of the effectiveness of the new legislation and the chemicals agency a monitoring system of the outputs and the results, as well as inputs used will be developed (building further on paragraph 5.1.1). The monitoring system will be developed by a steering committee consisting of DGEnterprise, Environment and JRC officials during the interim period and will be operational immediately after the entry into force of the legislation.

Depending on the indicators to be monitored, the initial responsibilities will rest with either the Agency [89], the Commission or the Member States [90].

[89] Normal operational and financial indicators will be monitored and reported by the Agency

[90] The Commission will carry responsibility for evaluating the indicators related to the impact assessment and Member States will produce their reports as indicated in 8.2.

8.2. Arrangements and schedule for the planned evaluation

In order to evaluate the implementation and effect of the new policy, the indicators as laid out in 5.1.1. will be gathered and monitored, mostly on an annual basis.

In this respect it should be recalled (see chapter 5) that the new policy is part of the Commission's wider sustainable development strategy. Its overriding goal is therefore to respect sustainable development by ensuring both a high level of protection of human health and the environment and the competitiveness of industry, within the framework of the Single Market.

Therefore, one of the key questions that needs to be addressed in this respect is the way REACH will contribute to meeting the objective of Action 04 "Getting still more from the Internal Market". One indicator to measure the degree of harmonisation in the chemicals area is the level of the integrity of the internal market for chemicals. This can be measured by identifying the number of national measures introduced or requested on this area and the number of internal trade conflicts which should reduce. This will be considered in detail during the yearly monitoring process and the evaluation of REACH.

In addition, the Regulation stipulates the following in Article 144 (Reporting)

Every ten years, Member States shall submit to the Commission a report on the operation of this Regulation in their respective territories, including sections on evaluation and enforcement in the format specified by Article 108. However, the first report shall be submitted five years after the entry into force of this Regulation.

Every ten years, the Agency shall submit to the Commission a report on the operation of this Regulation. However, the first report shall be submitted five years after the date of the notification required in Article130(2).

Every ten years, the Commission shall publish a general report on the experience acquired with the operation of this regulation, including the information referred to in paragraphs1 and 2. However, the first report shall be published six years after the date of the notification required in Article130 (2).

9. ANTI-FRAUD MEASURES

In order to combat fraud, corruption and other unlawful activities, the provisions of Regulation(EC)No1037/1999 shall apply without restrictions to this Agency.

The Agency shall accede to the Interinstitutional Agreement of May25,1999 concerning internal investigations by Olaf and shall issue, without delay, the appropriate provisions applicable to all of its staff.

The decisions concerning funding and the implementing agreements and instruments resulting from them shall explicitly stipulate that the Court of Auditors and Olaf may carry out, if necessary, on-the-spot checks of the recipients of the Agency's funding and the agents responsible for allocating it.

&gt;TABLE POSITION&gt;

&gt;TABLE POSITION&gt;

ANNEX 3

Applied methodology and main underlying assumptions for the financial model of the new chemicals agency

Applied staff costs (average per annum):

A-grade (1-4) EUR172.087

A-grade (5-8) EUR103.126

B-grade EUR82.609

C-grade EUR60.604

Bodies of Agency and their Support:

The cost for the Management Board contains amongst others the cost for the Executive Director plus an A-grade assistant.

For all bodies of the Agency, travel costs have been computed based on the assumed number of meetings. The number of meetings have either been estimated based on similar experiences in other Agencies (e.g. assumption that the Management Board meets 4 times per year), or based on the estimated number of dossiers a body has to deal with (e.g. in case of the Committees).

The number of meetings have been multiplied with the number of the members of the respective body and with the average travel/daily allowance costs (based on experiences of the European Chemicals Bureau (ECB) in Ispra).

In addition, staff costs have been added for some of the bodies, which will have a secretariat (Forum and Appeal Body).

In the case of the Committees, fees have also been added, which will be paid to the rapporteur of a dossier.

Personnel costs for REACH operations:

Due to the fact that the ECB is operating the current chemicals legislation, significant experience exists with regard to how long certain tasks take and what kind of qualifications are needed in order to carry them out (differentiation between A, B and C-grade).

Based on this experience, the ECB has developed a staff model for the operation of REACH. The output of the staff model is how many staff (split by grade) are required in a given year to fulfil the tasks of the agency.

The output of the staff model has been multiplied with the above-mentioned average cost per grade in order to derive the costs for operating the system.

Please note that he fluctuations in staff requirements are a result of the change in workload over time. The workload of the agency is directly related to the number of dossiers to be submitted by industry. Since reliable estimates exist for the total number of dossiers to be submitted during the 11 years, the number was broken down based on the deadlines introduced in the legislative text. ECB experience has shown that it is realistic to estimate that industry will submit the largest amount of dossiers shortly before a deadline expires. This explains why there are several peak-years (especially year 11, here the legislation sets the deadline for industry to submit dossiers for substances produced between 1-10 tonnes, these substances are estimated to account for 66% of total dossiers ~20.000).

Support functions related directly to REACH:

These costs include training of Member State Authorities, a help desk for industry and staff to give technical and scientific advice to the Member States. In addition, it has been assumed that some cost will arise from ad-hoc studies to be carried out by the Agency in relation to REACH.

Administrative Costs:

These costs are mainly staff costs for the over-head functions. The required staff numbers have been maintained through a feasibility study for the Agency carried out by Deloitte & Touche and through comparisons with other Agencies. In addition, recent regulations with regard to Regulatory Agencies have been taken into consideration and translated into staff requirements (e.g. Audit function).

The cost estimate for publication and documentation cost contains amongst others also the estimated translation costs, which will not be negligible based on the fact that the Agency will have to work in all 20 official languages in some areas of the REACH system.

ANNEX 4

TABLEAU DES EFFECTIFS STATUTAIRES

EUR 25 (based on financial model version 19)

&gt;TABLE POSITION&gt;

Justification:

In the interest of continuity of operations and in order to ensure that a minimum of knowledge is contained within the chemicals agency, it is deemed necessary that a limited number of positions should be permanent posts in order to create a 'corporate memory'.

However, to avoid that a single individual is carrying out a certain position for an unlimited number of years, it should be included in the guidelines of the Agency that a rotation system of the permanent staff within the different departments has to be introduced.

It is therefore proposed to have the following staff functions as permanent posts:

A-grades (5-8):

1 A-grade per area of the REACH system (registration, evaluation, assessment, authorisation)

Finance department (1 staff)

HR department (1 staff)

Secretariat of the Forum (1 staff)

Secretariat of the Appeal Body (1 staff)

B-grades:

1 B-grade per area of the REACH system (registration, evaluation, assessment, authorisation)

Secretariat of the Forum (1 staff)

Secretariat of the Appeal Body (1 staff)
